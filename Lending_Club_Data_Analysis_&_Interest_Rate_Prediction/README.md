# Machine Learning Model to predict Intrest Rate for Lending Club 

## ABOUT LENDING CLUB <br>
LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company. The company claims that $15.98 billion in loans had been originated through its platform up to December 31, 2015.

## OBJECTIVE: <br>
In this project, we are helping out client, an investor who wants to invest with lending club with the motivation to have a safe invest and avoid risk. Analysis on Lending club's dataset and applying different Machine Learning models to predict the interest rate for clients like Rick, who are risk averse investors.
