beyond fintech a pragmatic assessment of disruptive potential in financial services part of the future of financial services series prepared in collaboration with deloitte august foreword consistent with the world economic forums mission of applying a multistakeholder approach to address issues of global impact creating this report involved extensive outreach and dialogue with numerous organizations and individuals they included the forums financial services innovation and technology communities professionals from academia and the public sector the outreach involved over interviews and international workshop sessions encouraging collaborative dialogue to discuss insights and opportunities concerning fintech disruption within the financial services industry the holistic and

institute swift editors note the disruptive innovation in financial services project was launched at the world economic forum annual meeting in davos klosters in a world still consumed with navigating the aftershocks of the global financial crisis but in the wings a new challenge for the financial system was growing in the form of fintech new entrants that promised to rapidly reshape how financial products were structured provisioned and consumed nearly four years later as this initiative draws to a close we take the opportunity to reflect on the changes to the financial system taking stock of the impacts that fintechs have had and considering their evolving relationships with both incumbents and regulators more importantly it presents an opportunity to consider what lies beyond the horizon for financial services the technologies of the fourth industrial revolution have triggered a seismic shift in the financial system the implications of which will extend far beyond the fintechs that pioneered their use in financial services value chains that have characterized the industry for decades are being disrupted and reshaped with implications for customers regulators incumbents and every other stakeholder in the financial system in this fourth report of the future of financial services series we hope to build upon our previous work and provide the many stakeholders of the financial system with a better understanding of the forces transforming financial services as well as an outlook for its future r jesse mcwaters project lead disruptive innovation in financial services world economic forum rob galaski americas financial services leader deloitte contents context and approach key findings and uncertainties sector deep dives payments insurance digital banking lending investment management equity crowdfunding market infrastructure acknowledgements contact details section context and approach world economic forum context and approach past reports this report represents the culmination of three phases of research into the transformative role of fintechs on the financial services ecosystem since december the world economic forum has strived to understand the impact of innovations on the financial services ecosystem and to determine how all stakeholders would be affected phase phase laid out a foundation for understanding the transformative potential of new entrants and innovations on business models in financial services it focused on establishing a clear taxonomy for understanding which fintech innovations are the most relevant mapping possible futures for the evolutionary paths of emerging fintech innovations exploring the implications of fintech on key stakeholders consumers incumbents regulators etc phase outcomes are captured in the report the future of financial services phase phase aimed to illustrate the role of financial infrastructure in enabling the future of financial services it focused on understanding the transformative power of blockchain on shaping the future capabilities and characteristics of financial infrastructure defining a highlevel blueprint for fully digital identity protocols that simultaneously empowers users and simplifies and derisks identity transactions phase culminated in the release of two reports the future of financial infrastructure and a blueprint for digital identity what is a fintech in this document we define a fintech to be a small technologyenabled new entrant to financial services this definition does not include large technology firms that enter financial services eg apple with apple pay or incumbent financial institutions who increase their focus on technology context approach key findings key uncertainties context and approach current report context the final phase returns to the structure of the report conducting a broad exploration of the forces reshaping the financial services ecosystem this report builds on the work of the previous reports exploring the forces reshaping the structure of the financial system it also considers evolutionary paths for the future of the system as well as their implications for stakeholders report questions what are the innovations that have made the most impact on the financial ecosystem since the report and what are the ideas that have failed to produce impact how will these innovations impact the ways in which financial services are structured provisioned and consumed in the future what will be the implications of these innovations on the broader financial system bb partnerships emerging ecosystems context approach key findings key uncertainties context and approach project context over the last months the project team engaged with over experts and held workshops in order to answer pivotal questions industry leaders innovators gained oversight guidance and thought leadership from csuite executives operating unit leaders of global financial institutions and industry regulators held inperson and phone interviews with over innovative new entrants and subject matter experts facilitated multistakeholder workshops at six global financial hubs with over total participants including industry leaders innovators subject matter experts and regulators global workshops davosklosters switzerland january london uk february new york usa march april san francisco usa march shenzhen china april toronto canada may world economic forum context approach key findings key uncertainties section key findings and uncertainties world economic forum key findings overview fintechs have changed how financial services are structured provisioned and consumed but have not successfully established themselves as dominant players many fintechs small technologyenabled new entrants came into existence with the goal of overtaking incumbents as the new dominant players in financial services but have shifted to building partnerships as they struggle with scale and customer adoption where fintechs have succeeded where fintechs have fallen short fintechs have seized the initiative defining the direction shape and pace of innovation across almost every subsector of financial services and have succeeded as both standalone businesses and crucial parts of financial value chains fintechs have reshaped customer expectations setting new and higher bars for user experience through innovations like rapid loan adjudication fintechs have shown that the customer experience bar set by large technology firms such as apple and google can be met in financial services conclusion customer willingness to switch away from incumbents has been overestimated customer switching costs are high and new innovations are often not sufficiently material to warrant the shift to a new provider especially as incumbents adapt fintechs have struggled to create new infrastructure and establish new financial services ecosystems such as alternative payment rails or alternative capital markets they have been much more successful in making improvements within traditional ecosystems and infrastructure fintechs have materially changed the basis of competition in financial services but have not yet materially changed the competitive landscape caveat in geographies where incumbent service providers did not exist and in segments where incumbents where not meeting customer segments needs new entrants to financial services have been able to build significant scale context approach key findings key uncertainties key findings overview although fintechs have failed to disrupt the competitive landscape they have laid the foundation for future disruption the success of fintechs in changing the basis of competition as well as the increasing pace of technology means that while financial institutions have the potential to improve rapidly they face rapid disruption both now and in the future some financial institutions have turned the threat of fintechs into an opportunity the rapid growth of the fintech ecosystem allows firms to externalize parts of their innovation function as they wait and see which new offerings gain traction before deploying their the proliferation of fintechs provides financial institutions with a supermarket for capabilities allowing them to use acquisitions and partnerships to rapidly deploy new offerings own solutions but the accelerating rate of change represents a serious threat the accelerating tempo of the innovation cycle in financial services means that a financial institutions success is predicated on business model agility and the ability to rapidly deploy partnerships neither of which are traditional core competencies of these institutions context approach key findings key uncertainties the ability to shop the fintech landscape for capabilities is not limited to incumbent institutions today new entrants face significantly lower technological barriers to entering financial services with potential longterm implications for the competitive landscape key findings overview the project team has identified eight forces that have the potential to shift the competitive landscape of the financial ecosystem disruptive forces cost commoditization financial institutions will accelerate the commoditization of their cost bases removing them as points of competition and creating new grounds for differentiation profit redistribution technology and new partnerships will enable organizations to bypass traditional value chains thereby redistributing profit pools experience ownership power will transfer to the owner of the customer interface pure manufacturers must therefore become hyperscaled or hyperfocused platforms rising platforms that offer the ability to engage with different financial institutions from a single channel will become the dominant model for the delivery of financial services data monetization data will become increasingly important for differentiation but static data sets will be enriched by flows of data from multiple sources combined and used in real time bionic workforce as the ability of machines to replicate the behaviours of humans continues to evolve financial institutions will need to manage labour and capital as a single set of capabilities systemically important techs financial institutions increasingly resemble and are dependent on large tech firms to acquire critical infrastructure and differentiating technologies financial regionalization diverging regulatory priorities and customer needs will lead financial services in different regions of the world down distinct paths context approach key findings key uncertainties key findings cost commoditization financial institutions will accelerate the commoditization of their cost bases removing them as points of competition and creating new grounds for differentiation facing enormous pressure to reduce their cost base incumbent financial institutions are embracing new technologies as well as working with longtime competitors and new entrants alike to commoditize cost drivers that do not provide competitive differentiation archetypes mutualization externalization automation incumbents are exploring the creation of new utilities and the expansion of existing utilities roles in order to standardize processes and avoid duplicating work between companies the range of activities that financial institutions are comfortable with externalizing has expanded significantly creating opportunities for both fintechs and incumbents to serve these needs seeking to preserve margins incumbents are turning to process automation tools to streamline processes and lower internal costs of activities such as error handling example the monetary authority of singapore is working with several banks to build a national know your customer kyc utility which will reduce duplication and lower costs for all financial institutions context approach key findings example blackrocks aladdin platform provides risk analysis portfolio construction and compliance tools for institutional investors and retail wealth managers the platform provides technology and support for industrystandard processes key uncertainties example automation anywhere is working with a wide range of banks to automate processes such as loan origination audit compliance and account reconciliation key findings cost commoditization sharing costs among peers and utilizing industrystandard automation tools will deverticalize the value chain implications for fintechs the rise of costsharing utilities and bb providers lowers the barriers to entry for new entrants implications for all financial institutions organizations must view partnerships and ecosystem management as a companywide strategic focus organizations will have to start thinking of security and permissions as a jigsaw each piece will have to be treated separately to minimize the threat from any new external connection organizations will need to improve tracking of data flows to protect users as information is shared with external companies implications for regulators regulators need to monitor the growth of utilities and businesstobusiness bb service providers and consider their potential systemic risks fintechs regulators incumbents implications for incumbents incumbents will need to differentiate their customerfacing processes as middle and back offices become commoditized context approach key findings key uncertainties key findings profit redistribution technology and new partnerships will enable organizations to bypass traditional value chains thereby redistributing profit pools the location of profit pools within and between value chains will shift as technological catalysts enable companies to change their positions and relationships archetypes intravalue chain disruption intervalue chain shifts technological value bridge existing value chain participants are bypassing traditional intermediaries and seeking partnerships directly with customerfacing startups thereby becoming direct competitors with past partners technology is allowing consumers to easily switch between products in different value chains migrating profit pools to new organizations new technologies can simplify connections within large and complicated networks making companies that focused on connecting participants more vulnerable to disruption example munich re a large reinsurer is partnering with product startups including bought by many and trv to directly compete with their traditional insurance partners example investment firms such as vanguard and betterment have started proposing exchangetraded funds etfs as an alternative to savings accounts shifting customers from bank deposits example stripe offers online merchants an easy and costeffective way to process payments online which was previously only accessible to large merchants with merchant bank accounts context approach key findings key uncertainties key findings profit redistribution as profit pools shift due to value chain movements intermediaries will face competitive pressure from all sides archetypes continued regulatory disruption regulators are curtailing financial institutions control over access to infrastructure lowering market power and shifting profits away from firms that oversee infrastructure example the european unions revised payment services directive psd threatens to disintermediate payment networks by mandating that banks allow open secure connections between merchants and user accounts implications for fintechs implications for regulators the pool of potential partners that can provide scale capital and customer reach will expand beyond traditional adjacencies regulators must monitor the shift in profit pools in order to identify the new value chain as longregulated companies become less relevant and new companies grow in importance fintechs regulators incumbents implications for all financial institutions technology will reduce the cost of bypassing value chain intermediaries and reaching the end customer companies will need to monitor their adjacencies for potential pressuresshifts from partners implications for incumbents intermediaries that derive value from their position on the value chain will struggle to be profitable scale will be necessary for survival context approach key findings key uncertainties key findings experience ownership power will transfer to the owner of the customer experience pure manufacturers must therefore become hyperscaled or hyperfocused the rise of platforms means incumbents can no longer rely on controlling both product manufacturing and distribution allowing product distributors to leverage control of their customer experience and place pressure on manufacturers archetypes brand opportunity product curation control of data distributors ownership of the customer relationship places them in a position to grow their brand while deemphasizing that of the manufacturer particularly in cases where products are commoditized example customers of roboadvisors such as wealthfront purchase etfs from a wide range of companies but likely have limited awareness of the assets in their portfolio distributors control which products are distributed and how customers view products and can even steer customers towards certain products via recommendations the distributors location in a value chain allows it to collect data that is both deep across the entire value chain and broad data on all product manufacturers example the apple app store allows almost all apps that pass a set of rules but stringently controls the front page crucial for visibility with over apps launched per day example mastercard offers retailers advisory services with benchmarks and recommendations drawn from its visibility into data collected from comparable retailers context approach key findings key uncertainties key findings experience ownership customers will interact with fewer and fewer distributors in the future as the market consolidates and major firms gain market share implications for fintechs fintechs lacking both an existing customer base and the ability to scale quickly will have to find niches if they wish to become distributors in contrast distributors may help fintechs compete with incumbents as manufacturers of specialized financial products implications for all financial institutions all firms will seek to be distributors of both their products and those of others their success will depend on the existing market and whether they can capture mindshare product distributors may struggle to achieve ubiquity and consistency of experience across an increasingly fragmented universe of connected devices implications for all players product distribution represents a likely point of entry for large tech firms due to their expertise fintechs regulators implications for regulators regulators will have to guard against product distributors abusing their market power especially in open platforms where distributors control the customer shopping experience questions about how distributors and manufacturers share liability will have farreaching consequences incumbents implications for incumbents incumbents will have advantages in the race to become distributors due to their existing customer base however incumbents that fail to become product distributors will see a decline in product profit margins due to cost commoditization context approach key findings key uncertainties key findings platforms rising platforms that offer the ability to engage with different financial institutions from a single channel will become the dominant model for the delivery of financial services the shift to multipleprovider platforms as a channel to distribute and trade is gradually emerging across geographies and throughout a wide range of financial products here are just a few examples of what has been developed archetypes bc product distribution platforms segment platforms data aggregation platforms retail distribution of financial products will take place within digital platforms either open or curated where customers will have the ability to choose between multiple providers preexisting platforms that cater to specific business needs and audiences will add financial products in effect becoming distribution channels for financial services platforms that aggregate customer data from different financial institutions will increase in number and scope reaching all sectors and allowing customers greater control over their data example tencents webank platform acts as a storefront allowing retail customers to purchase products from multiple competing vendors of credit and asset management services example waves accounting invoicing and reporting platform for small businesses offers key financial services such as payments or lending directly as well as through partners like adp and rbc example the united kingdom is developing a pensions dashboard aggregating information from insurers and asset managers to allow customers to view and manage all their savings in one location context approach key findings key uncertainties key findings platforms rising the rise of customer choice will have profound implications on the design and distribution of products and will force companies to shift roles implications for fintechs platforms allow productfocused fintechs the opportunity to scale quickly implications for all financial institutions fintechs regulators implications for regulators uncertainties around who is the responsible party will need to be resolved in both bc and bb markets for issues such as product suitability and liability product differentiation will become critical where institutions do not control the salesdistribution channel platform owners will need to become capable ecosystem managers balancing the needs of the product manufacturers with customer demand platforms will naturally capture market data from all participants adding to the platform owners market power platform owners and product owners will need to address open questions about the liability of products placed on platforms incumbents implications for incumbents products will need to be standalone profitable to be sustainable in a platform environment no more loss leaders improved price comparability will favour large incumbents where product economies of scale exist context approach key findings key uncertainties key findings data monetization data will become increasingly important for differentiation but static data sets will be enriched by flows of data from multiple sources combined and used in real time organizations will have to use a combination of data strategies to collect the depth and breadth of data needed to follow the lead of tech firms in data monetization archetypes flows vs snapshots experiencedriven data partnerships for data institutions are starting to collect real time data flows in order to utilize advanced analytics and target customers who change their behaviour and needs over time example visa mobile location confirmation which is optional and offered through participating financial institutions mobile banking apps uses mobile geolocation information as an addition to visas predictive fraud analytics in order to expand their customer data sets to collect new streams of data institutions are designing their digital experience to offer more customer value thus engaging customers more frequently partnerships with other companies solely for the purpose of data collection will increase allowing banks and nonbanks to collect complementary data they otherwise would not have access to example facebook continually improves and adds features to its mobile app to increase customer engagement and collect more data points example aib is partnering with retailers to offer cashbacks to customers in return retailers receive customer data which they can use to provide targeted offers context approach key findings key uncertainties key findings data monetization as financial institutions seek to increase the amount and variety of data they collect ownership and control of data will become a key issue for all stakeholders implications for fintechs incumbents will need help to manage use and secure their data creating a new business line for fintechs implications for all financial institutions data security will be crucial in establishing and maintaining trust with the customer new partnerships based on data will create an imperative for a company wide partnership strategy national data regulators will play a larger role in financial services fintechs regulators incumbents implications for regulators regulators must carefully monitor the sharing of data to ensure that the risk of hacking is as low as possible regulators must also be aware of how banks use the additional data they collect and whether customers understand the impact of sharing their information regulators must decide how much consumers can control their own information that they have shared with institutions implications for incumbents incumbents will have to decide on the value of migrating existing data in legacy systems to environments where it can be more effectively maintained versus implementing tools and strategies for collecting new data context approach key findings key uncertainties key findings bionic workforce the arrival of new technologies such as artificial intelligence will mean major shifts in financial institutions workforces as the definition of talent evolves organizations will need to manage talent as a collective set of employees and machineenabled solutions especially as cognitive technologies continue to develop and increase in relative importance archetypes frontend ai coworking with ai suite of capabilities the public face through which customers interact with financial organizations will be ai similar to the ai now dominating interactions between customers and tech firms example bank of america is launching erica a chatbot in order to engage with customers and offer answers in the mould of apples siri or amazons alexa humans and computers working together will have a force multiplying effect compared to humans or ai alone given enough training and role definition as an organizations workforce shifts from being solely human to a humanai mix suites of capabilities leadership will shift its focus from managing teams of people to managing example ayasdi worked with a major bank to improve its stress testing from a ninemonth process requiring hundreds of employees to a threemonth process using less than specialists example while this idea has yet to be tested academia is gradually accepting the need to manage ai similarly to humans sources hbr mit sloan management review context approach key findings key uncertainties key findings bionic workforce the evolution of talent will fundamentally shift the role of human capital within financial institutions implications for fintechs ai and automationfocused fintechs will be in demand as companies seek to quickly gain expertise implications for all financial institutions ai risk management will be a priority ai represents a single point of failure technological improvements are likely to come in waves meaning that changes from ai will impact some parts of the organization at different rates than others companies will need to manage the balance between humanai interactions and train their employees to effectively coexist with ai fintechs regulators incumbents implications for regulators regulators will need to develop new strategies for dealing with ai including enforcement and punishment of non compliant actions by ai implications for incumbents incumbents will have to figure out how to communicate their culture through customerfacing ai incumbents will need to have a strategy on how to acquire ai expertise context approach key findings key uncertainties key findings systemically important techs financial institutions increasingly resemble and are dependent on large tech firms to acquire critical infrastructure and differentiating technologies the rise of digital interfaces and data in financial institutions means that those institutions increasingly focus on developing large tech capabilities which is accompanied by an increased reliance on large tech firms archetypes infrastructure platforms and data digital experience financial institutions of all sizes are increasingly dependent on large techs cloudbased infrastructure to scale and deploy processes and to harness artificial intelligence ai as a service financial institutions have used the example of large techs successfully unlocking data and revenues from customer platforms to guide and shape their own efforts large techs have focused for years on making their customers digital experience simple and painfree and financial institutions are now moving to match this standard example amazon web services aws is forming the backbone of the financial services ecosystem with a diverse set of firms from jp morgan to startups such as xignite adopting aws for data storage and processing example jp morgan is investing in the collection and analysis of its customers data with a new customer management and analytics tool enabling crossselling a little bit like how amazon suggests what you might like to buy next example macquarie bank is using uber and google as guides for its digital experience you as a customer should be interacting with a bank in the same way you interact with the rest of your life sources ft cmo context approach key findings key uncertainties key findings systemically important techs the coming collision between financial institutions and large techs leads to tough choices for all firms become dependent on large techs or risk falling behind implications for fintechs fintechs may have opportunities to work with large techs to broaden their reach while also helping large techs enter financial markets fintechs may be attractive targets for incumbents seeking to acquire technical talent implications for all financial institutions all financial institutions will need to find ways to partner with large techs without losing their core value proposition all firms risk becoming dependent on large techs which necessitates the loss of some control over both costs and data fintechs regulators incumbents implications for regulators how large techs are treated under traditional regulatory frameworks will have a large impact on their interactions with financial institutions implications for incumbents incumbents will have to compete with large techs for talent driving up the cost of technology talent incumbents risk falling far behind on technological offerings if they minimize engagement with large techs to protect independence context approach key findings key uncertainties key findings financial regionalization differing regulatory priorities technological capabilities and customer conditions are challenging the narrative of increasing financial globalization the trend towards financial globalization is giving way to regional models of financial services suited to local conditions led by the complexity of differing customer needs and differences in solutions around the world archetypes europe china usa a strong regulatory impetus for open data and consumer protection is driving the development of platform ecosystems in many verticals with incumbents under growing pressure a mobilebased connectivity ecosystem the absence of major consumerfocused bank offerings and a largely innovation friendly regulator all lead to large techs capturing significant market share unclear regulatory direction as well as the presence of a mature financial ecosystem and wellserved customers means that changes to the current ecosystem will likely be incremental example the european markets in financial services directive is designed to introduce more transparency to capital markets trade execution firms must show clear evidence of best execution example in the absence of a mature payments system the alipay mobile payment app now owns over of the trillion chinese mobile payments sector with tech giant tencent as its only major competitor example the automated clearing house ach network is moving to sameday payments but progress remains slow compared to other countries such as the united kingdom which adopted realtime payments over a decade ago context approach key findings key uncertainties key findings financial regionalization increasingly divergent regional financial systems mean that local players could quickly gain market share but international growth is difficult implications for fintechs fintechs will face serious obstacles to establishing themselves in multiple jurisdictions even as technology theoretically lowers barriers to entry implications for regulators regulators will face two opposed pressures large incumbents will push for global convergence and local firms will press for localized regulations fintechs regulators incumbents implications for all financial institutions the breeding ground for fintech innovation may become even more multipolar as firms with offerings specialized to their locale will strengthen regional fintech hubs new ideas can be tested in one geography and introduced to other areas once conditions change regionalization of emerging capabilities will force the creation of different solutions to similar problems context approach key findings key uncertainties implications for incumbents global firms will need distinct strategies to cultivate regional competitive advantages and integrate with local ecosystems incumbents may become attractive partners for fintechs seeking to enter new markets as they look for opportunities to rapidly scale key findings crosscutting uncertainties in addition to the key findings the following open questions will shape the industrys development the path forward however is uncertain these questions will influence the future of all financial services sectors and are thus often subjects of discussion but the current discussion holds more questions than answers uncertainties role of identity monetization of data flows technology governance gap how will the rise of digital identity impact its use in financial services around the world how can firms extract the most revenues from the data available to them how much will it cost how will financial services firms mitigate risk when technology races ahead of managements ability to understand the consequences systemic transparency cooperation problems how will the transparency built into new systems impact their design participants roles or their profit models can financial services firms use technology to solve longrunning partnership and collaboration issues that lie at the heart of the industry context approach key findings key

tracker on each page illustrates the readers position in the sector deep dive introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion section payments world economic forum payments introduction payments have greatly evolved in the last several years this section examines the key trends shaping the industry and the uncertain path forward the first half of this decade saw rapid change in the payments landscape with the global entry of several innovative forces that raised fundamental questions about the future of payments circa the major forces impacting payments were mobile payments alternative payment rails seamless payments the launch of apple pay opened the developed world to the potential of mobile payments interest grew in the potential applications of alternative currencies such as bitcoin uber familiarized users with a payment experience that had no moment of payment circa the big uncertainties about the future of payments were how might the dominant form factor of payments change will incumbent payment networks be able to respond to new entrants payments infrastructure what role will payments play in the broader suite of offerings from financial institutions will the rise of multinationals eg apple pay lead to global payment convergence note for the purposes of distinguishing online and inperson brickandmortar shopping all instances of retail refer to brickandmortar shopping introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion payments overview of findings payments have continued their migration to digital channels in the face of geographically varied adoption of mobile payment and declining profitability where did disruption occur a b c payments have continued to migrate away from cash and become less visible to the customer as consumers shift purchases to online and mobile channels payments businesses are experiencing intense pressure on margins in the face of competition and a challenging regulatory environment regional distinctions between payments ecosystems are growing as both customer behaviour and regulatory environments diverge where has disruption not occurred d e mobile payment solutions have not sufficiently exceeded the functionality of preexisting solutions in cardbased markets thus limiting their adoption customer acceptance of nontraditional payment schemes eg alternative currencies remains almost nonexistent introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion payments finding a payments have continued to migrate away from cash and become less visible to the customer as consumers shift purchases to online and mobile channels on the back of global shifts in commerce patterns from inperson to online payment volumes and channels have naturally shifted away from cash towards simple frictionless solutions which are often operated by large tech firms supporting evidence dominance of online sales the global online shopping market is growing quickly at the expense of inperson shopping and therefore onlinebased cashless solutions will dominate the overall transaction landscape increase in mobile connectedness especially in emerging economies the near ubiquity of mobile phones combined with the lack of development in traditional financial solutions is driving the development of technologically advanced mobilebased solutions for payments growing role of online platforms large tech firms are driving the development of online payment platforms in ecommerce causing payments to become less visible to the customer the action of logging in to an online platform is sufficient to enable a transaction with actual payment details stored in the background introduction findings a b c d e uncertainties end states conclusion payments finding a payments have continued to migrate away from cash and become less visible to the customer as consumers shift purchases to online and mobile channels continued case studies growth of online payment platform shift to online sales amazons online store growth represented of overall us e commerce growth in driven by the success of amazon prime which now has million subscribers amazon is also creating an ecosystem around its oneclick payment service by rolling it out to other merchants in direct competition with paypal for example the growth of chinas inperson retail shopping market slowed to in november its lowest level of growth in over a decade as customers shifted their shopping from retail to online channels sales on singles day which represents the biggest oneday sale in chinas online shopping market grew more than in quantitative evidence change in us black friday shoppers by channel million online inperson shift from retail to online shopping key uncertainties the incompatibility between cash and digital marketplaces means that payments will only continue to move towards cashless solutions will dominant online payment processors eg amazon stripe expand into inperson retail and if so can they achieve scale sources slice intelligence ft cnbc fortunecom how will card networks react to the rising importance of large techs in online payments in emerging markets can incumbents enter and overcome locally built solutions introduction findings a b c d e uncertainties end states conclusion payments finding b payments businesses are experiencing intense pressure on margins in the face of competition and a challenging regulatory environment increasing competition coupled with regulatory forces and the rise of new solutions on top of the traditional ecosystem means that payment profitability will decline in the future supporting evidence interchange caps several jurisdictions including europe canada and australia have either passed or are passing legislation limiting the fees charged on transactions thus limiting profitability for all intermediaries europe specifically is implementing the eu interchange fee regulation ifr and weakening honour all cards rules which forbid merchants from selective card acceptance making highfee credit cards unattractive for merchants to accept eroding lending revenue revolvers customers who use credit cards as shortterm loans with high interest rates are a major source of card profits this market is facing serious pressure with the increase in alternative lenders who target the same customers and offer more attractive interest rates faster payment schemes the development of nationallevel faster payment schemes will lead to a decrease in revenues from other payment sources wire transfers cheques etc as customers move to new platforms also where nationallevel faster payment schemes exist fees to the end consumer are nonexistent conditioning customers to expect lowfee payments in all transactions new foreign exchange solutions technologically advanced fintechs are moving into both the retail and bb areas lowering revenues that financial institutions can earn on foreign exchange fx several banks have decided to partner with a fintech solution to offer fx services instead of operating their own forgoing that income entirely introduction findings a b c d e uncertainties end states conclusion payments finding b payments businesses are experiencing intense pressure on margins in the face of competition and a challenging regulatory environment continued case studies quantitative evidence

where merchants have resisted adoption open payments regulation the coming rollout of psd will advance the development of new payment schemes in europe and other jurisdictions that adopt similar legislation such as australia but it is highly unlikely that changes to european payments will influence the regulation of us markets demonetization countries that embrace demonetization will force

application of the european unions revised payment services directive psd by january will greatly shift the payments landscape in europe psd represents a host of changes to the original payments services directive psd passed in focusing on four broad themes market efficiency consumer protection competition and choice and security key changes effect on payments the main change to the original psd consists of two new entities with banks creating a model of simple and secure access payment initiation services account information services these allow users to initiate payments directly from their bank accounts to merchants these allow users to authorize services to access their bank account information concurrently the european union is rolling out two major paymentsrelated changes as part of ifr interchange fee regulation interchange fees are capped at of transaction value for debit and credit respectively the honour all cards rule forbidding merchants from selective card acceptance no longer applies instead cards are now sorted by category and retailers can choose which category of cards to accept payment initiation services allow merchants to link directly to the customers bank account bypassing a series of traditional intermediaries to lower costs account information services will allow services that are dependent on customer info such as account aggregation services like mint and yodlee to operate without bank account passwords increasing security key uncertainties what will the psd implementation timeline be and how will banks react how will eu regulators monitor and enforce the degree of institutional compliance with psd and will this differ by country will this drive innovation at the merchantintermediary level and will customers adapt payments finding d mobile payment solutions have not sufficiently exceeded the functionality of pre existing solutions in cardbased markets thus limiting their adoption mobile payment solutions have not become as pervasive in the united states and europe as in other parts of the world due to the overwhelming dominance of cardbased solutions supporting evidence switching costs vs incremental value customers are reluctant to try a new method of payment mobile without a clear demonstrated improvement ingrained behaviours mean that the less significant of an improvement a new solution represents the less patience customers will have with it lack of ecosystem support the ubiquity of cardbased technologies has meant that many vendors simply do not support mobile payments and it is often difficult to identify vendors that do this creates a negative loop around the technology the less support the less customers will want to adopt which leads to less support lack of single standard many cardbased markets also lack one consistent mobile payment standard meaning that even if stores accept mobile payments it is often unclear which one of several solutions will worknot work further

uncertainties around payments largely concern the move to digital and online with the effects of regionalization also playing a role what we know the five payment findings illustrate the massive pressures on the payments industry on the one hand heightened competition and a challenging regulatory environment are leading to steadily declining profits on the other customers are reluctant to switch to nontraditional payment schemes without seeing significant benefits thereby limiting adoption of new technologies through these findings the following key uncertainties about the future of payments emerged uncertainties will the future of payments diverge into two worlds retail and online or can they be bridged who is best positioned to benefit from the monetization of payments data will psd successfully create new payments value chains in europe will mobile payments ever capture a major doubledigit share of retail payments in cardbased countries what will the first national digital currency look like and how far away is it possible futures the resolution of these five key uncertainties paints three diverging pictures of the future of the payments industry loss leader two ecosystems postpsd increasing fragmentation introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion payments potential end states depending on how the key uncertainties are resolved the potential end states have very different evolutionary paths and implications for all firms loss leader two ecosystems postpsd increasing fragmentation the first end state paints a world where issuers face lower interchange revenues customers turn to alternatives for revolving credit customers are conditioned to expect free payments payment choices for customers decline the second end state paints a world where banks develop open payment application programming interfaces apis merchants develop online payment tools that bypass intermediaries the online and retail payments ecosystem diverges customers are entrenched in online ecosystems the third end state paints a world where merchants and intermediaries create personalized payment solutions customers adopt a wide variety of payment tools aggregated flows of data become difficult to acquire monetization of data becomes much more difficult introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion payments end state one as payments move from being a cash cow to a loss leader market leaders look for new strategies and the rest look for partnerships incumbent creditcard issuer revenues decline precipitously as interchange shrinks and alternatives to revolving credit gain even more popularity additionally the development of new payment processing systems allows much greater customer access to realtime payments with the expectation of low fees many market incumbents and new challengers adopt a partnership model for payments seeking to minimize losses while still offering bestofbrand solutions to their customers some market leaders see this as an opportunity to create new revenue streams via data monetization or use payments to lock customers into an ecosystem critical conditions early signs the worldwide trend of governments limiting interchange rates and weakening the power of honour all cards rules continues merchants push banks and credit cards to offer more ie data sharing for their fees and hold out if no agreement is reached low interest rates and an easy money monetary policy means that alternatives to revolvers remain easily available to most consumers realtime faster payments systems are successfully deployed in various key geographies around the world banks start to reevaluate their rewards and loyalty offerings on cards offering customers less banks start to partner with fintechs that offer payment services introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion payments end state one merchants benefit the most from this world and customers may benefit while intermediaries will likely suffer the most implications for customers fewer issuers means fewer credit card choices the remaining choices often represent better value for money solutions will increasingly be free of charge where allowed by law data may be shared with multiple parties as an alternative revenue stream implications for merchants more bargaining power means less fees paid to card issuers and intermediaries the opportunity exists to negotiate for more dataother benefits in return for fees loss leader implications for intermediaries less interchange means less profit per transaction intermediaries have the opportunity to gain market share as banks withdraw from paymentrelated activities in favour of partnerships implications for card issuers regulations and the appearance of alternatives mean that revenues associated with the issuing of cards will decline an opportunity to gain market share arises as some card issuers will stop issuing cards data increases in importance as a profit driver introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion payments end state two postpsd the world of online and retail payments could diverge significantly creating two distinct ecosystems banks are required to develop open apis that allow trusted third parties to easily and securely access customer accounts merchants large online ones in particular expand their current online systems to easily tap into those apis moving traffic away from traditional cards large techs design their systems eg apple pay amazon oneclick with direct bank connections builtin and offer these to other online retailers to capture payments data customers fundamentally move away from card based online payment schemes whereas pointof sale behaviours are slower to adapt creating two distinct ecosystems critical conditions early signs hard psd or other regulations exist that force banks to develop simple secure and effective apis open to third parties large tech solutions are developed that easily tie into these apis and allow for some information sharing banks comply with psd in europe on time to eu specifications parties from any two of three groups merchants banks and large techs form partnerships to develop solutions that allow easy consumer adoption the continued absence of a comprehensive digital identity scheme prevents the online ecosystem from easily integrating with retail payments postpsd credit card usage holds steady in retail stores introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion payments end state two the implications for customers are unclear but merchants benefit greatly on the back of shrinking profits for intermediaries implications for customers direct connections with banks for online purchases mean less justification for credit card fees adoption of online solutions may mean customers are more deeply entrenched in large tech ecosystems implications for merchants less fees are paid to card issuers and intermediaries as more customers use direct solutions the opportunity exists to choose partnerships with issuersintermediaries if benefits align two ecosystems postpsd implications for intermediaries volumes and margins decline as some retailers and banks bypass traditional intermediaries consolidation is therefore likely as players fight for a larger share of a smaller pool of profit lack of online business forces a shift of focus to retail shopping to retain profits implications for card issuers use of revolvers may decline somewhat as customers charge less to the card issuers may ally with partners to push the use of their credit cards driving up usage introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion payments end state three instead of convergence in payments the field of payments may fragment as merchants intermediaries and schemes all seek to differentiate even more fintech and other nonbank payment solutions start appearing in the marketplace further fragmenting the payment experience for customers as all solutions are based around credit card usage customers find it relatively easy to juggle multiple different payment apps and tools and are rewarded with incentives market incumbents and credit card issuers continue to take their share of revenues but have difficulty piecing together a customers spending patterns as a result data aggregation and monetization schemes mostly fail to get off the ground presenting banks with a quandary regarding payments revenue critical conditions early signs retailers both instore and online continue to develop customized payment solutions and invest in rewardloyalty schemes to get customers to use those solutions banks fail to bridge the skulevel data gap the number of retail apps on a typical customers smartphone continues to increase credit card usage online does not decline no predominant payment channel appears out of the competitive landscape introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion payments end state three customers enjoy individually tailored experiences but may lose track of spending while banks gain power as they track a customers entire payment profile implications for customers more bespoke solutions lead to individually tailored payment experiences however more fragmentation may lead to difficulty tracking spending due to many sources of payments implications for merchants tailored payment experiences with loyalty rewards encourage app usage and may lead to more customer adoption increasing fragmentation implications for intermediaries credit card fees continue or even rise as more credit card usage gets built into apps however nascent data monetization platforms largely fail due to a lack of information sharing as a result consolidation may occur as it is required to collectmake sense of customer data as customers struggle to manage spending habits tools that offer tracking and advice could thrive implications for card issuers the base act of card issuing does not largely decline in revenue cards continue to compete on rewards banks have the only complete picture of the customers spending thus retaining control over data introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion payments conclusion key takeaways for financial institutions data monetization new competition and increased regulation will continue to make core payment activities less profitable pushing payment providers to focus on data monetization as an important source of revenue data streams will be significantly more valuable where they are granular eg productlevel data and multidimensional eg location data making data cooperation and partnerships critical to successful monetization local payment needs instead of designing payment solutions based on technology institutions will focus on how their customers prefer to pay and design payment solutions that fit their customers lives which will lead to regional solutions furthermore emerging countries without a mature payments ecosystem will likely take the lead in developing payment solutions power of large merchants as the ability of large merchants to influence their customers payment choices grows particularly in online transactions their negotiating power within the payments ecosystem will grow accordingly combined with the increased importance of productlevel payments data merchants will be able to wield this power to lower fees and influence the broader evolution of payments ecosystems introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion payments references references echo

the channel implications for insurtechs the mainstreaming of insurtechs focused on customerspecific experiences will benefit customer choice but may force the insurtechs into niches mainstreaming will also attract willing partners and create opportunities to white label products implications for customers customers will benefit from products tailored to their needs customers who are heavy users and thus benefit from onesizefitsall insurance may have to pay more introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion insurance end state two insurers find it hard to keep up with rapid developments in ai and thus outsource underwriting causing a bifurcation of the market pc the amount of technological sophistication needed to run an insurance company rises as algorithms take over underwriting to manage the technology insurers partner with a wide selection of vendors for their expertise in underwriting analytics effectively outsourcing underwriting as underwriting becomes outsourced it loses its value as a differentiator and insurers focus on differentiating themselves based on customer service and scale alternatively some insurers seek to pursue specialized slices of the market offering affinity products that appeal to a narrow range of consumers critical conditions early signs ai development in underwriting advances significantly insurers work with bb vendorsutilities instead of inhouse especially to drive advancements in underwriting insurers start cutting staff in underwriting departments as they outsourcedepend on vendors insurers start offering affinity policies introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion insurance end state two customers benefit but new entrants especially affinity players may suffer from lack of scale in addition insurers have to find new ways to differentiate themselves implications for incumbent insurers distribution and scale are more important than ever increasing the likelihood of consolidation pooling of risks ceases to exist as pricing sophistication leads to individualized riskbased pricing nonscale incumbents must find ways of differentiating themselves implications for regulators the externalization of underwriting could mean fewer models to monitor but it also creates the risk of a single point of failure underwriting by machine implications for insurtechs insurtechs catering to affinity customers face competition from insurers that seek to specialize some insurtechs may evolve to become bb underwriting and claims processing providers implications for customers customers either benefit by paying less or by being served better under an affinity introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion insurance end state three the rise of insurance that covers changes in behaviour role and risk profile over time means insurers must solve how to monitor products pc life consumers insurance needs are becoming more specific as their jobs and activities drive frequent changes to their risk profile and coverage needs the rise of parttimers and prosumers means that insurers have to introduce flexible coverage forcing them to connect their business and personal lines the rise of productspecific insurance eg for a bike or phone also means that insurers have to be smarter about measuring and tracking product usage as a result insurers introduce timeflexible and eventdriven policies engaging with customers to find the best ways to control when insurance coverage is turned on and off critical conditions early signs the shift towards selfemployment continues around the world connected products that allow monitoring of turn on turn off insurance grow in popularity insurers start entering into partnerships or acquisitions with prosumerfocused insurtechs insurers and gig economy firms launch partnerships to cover workers insurers work to build in coverage for internetenabled products introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion insurance end state three incumbents and insurtechs would have to invest in tracking and digital solutions to protect against customer mistakes that lead to miscoverage implications for incumbent insurers the increase in monitoring signals a fundamental shift in the role of insurers from risk transfer to risk monitoring and management turn on turn off insurance means insurers will have to invest in monitoring technologies implications for regulators using connected tools for monitoring customers will create new data concerns for regulators focused on consumer protection rise of the flexible product implications for insurtechs the rise of flexible insurance means that insurtechs specializing in prosumers or connected products will have many partnership opportunities insurtechs will have to carefully measure claims rates for fraud detection implications for customers customers will benefit from flexible insurance products that can be modified to suit their needs insurance that can be turned on and off may lead customers to struggle with inadvertent coverage gaps introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion insurance end state four demographics and market maturity mean emerging markets will provide the bulk of life insurance growth and digital distribution is key life growth in life insurance comes from younger customer bases in emerging markets that have different needs and a familiarity with digital channels however current models of growth in these markets revolve around hiring more agents to sell on the ground adding to costs and missing an opportunity to deploy digital tools leading insurers shift their focus away from retirement to shortterm increasingly flexible products matching the needs of people in emerging markets the rise of term products means insurers also focus more on digital channels of distribution which aligns with shopping patterns in many emerging markets critical conditions early signs increasing demand for life insurance in africa southeast asia and south america drives life insurers profits insurtechs push incumbents by offering digital life insurance products in key locales the lack of knowledge about complicated life insurance products persists current demographic patterns continue a global life insurer undergoes major restructuring ie de emphasizing agents in key locales simple term products become increasingly popular introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion insurance end state four insurers that can offer digital distribution without compromising underwriting stand to capture market share and provide customers with additional coverage implications for incumbent insurers the shift to term products and digital distribution means life insurers will start looking much like pc insurers in their structure this shift will foster industry consolidation as companies seek scale to drive profits from lowermargin term products implications for regulators the rise of digital channels may mean a more attractive target for data theft regulators will have to ensure adequate data protection ez life insurance implications for insurtechs insurtechs will have a competitive advantage in emerging markets due to their local nature and could represent good targets for acquisition they can be a useful tool for spreading innovations between borders either organically or with a partners help implications for customers customers will benefit from products that better suit their age demographic eg term life products introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion insurance conclusion key takeaways for financial institutions value chain shift once tightly vertically integrated the insurance value chain is rapidly being modularized by new technologies that allow for splitting activities across many different players leading organizations are using this modularity to their advantage pursing flexible partnerships that allow them to aggressively compete for adjacent profit pools complex products simply distributed to remain competitive insurers need to simultaneously achieve two seemingly contradictory objectives on the one hand they must develop complex and highly personalized products to meet customers needs on the other they will need to significantly simplify the origination process enabling even highly complex products to be sold directly through online and mobile channels connections changing the insurer connected insurance will fundamentally change the way insurers operate shifting their focus from risk assessment to risk prevention and creating the imperative to work with original equipment manufacturers to build in connections to achieve this however insurers must overcome existing perceptions of connected insurance products

world economic forum digital banking introduction digital banking has greatly evolved in the last several years this section examines the key trends shaping the industry and the uncertain path forward the first half of this decade saw the start of a shift in digital banking with the entry of several new forces that changed the online and mobile banking ecosystem and had the potential to change the way customers bank circa the major forces impacting digital banking were virtual banks mobile channels banking platforms virtual banks improved their offerings to differentiate themselves from incumbents all banks developed mobile channels though incumbents often struggled banks began to use technology to enable thirdparty applications circa the big uncertainties about the future of digital banking were would virtual banks be able to capture market share from incumbents how would the emergence of banking platforms affect developments in digital banking how would banks be able to deploy digital solutions with legacy architecture introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion digital banking overview of findings banking is on the cusp of significant disruption as regulations and technology begin to lay the foundations of a fundamental shift in the business model where did disruption occur a b c traditional bank distribution models and economics are at risk of being deeply disrupted by the drive towards platform models of banking banks no longer define customer expectations of the banking experience instead fintechs and large technology companies set the standard incumbents are starting to migrate core systems to the cloud as legacy infrastructure creates challenges in meeting customer needs where has disruption not occurred d few customers have moved away from traditional deposit accounts despite significant efforts from online and mobile challenger banks introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion digital banking finding a traditional bank distribution models and economics are at risk of being deeply disrupted by the drive towards platform models of banking catalysed by regulators and driven by a desire to more efficiently satisfy customer needs platform banking business models where banks offer connections with other firms in addition to their own are gaining momentum supporting evidence increasing technology capacity increasing regulatory pressure shrinking margins apis as software intermediaries that allow programmes to connect and interact provide exposurespecific functionality while protecting the rest of the application this technology which has achieved broad adoption in recent years allows banks to seamlessly integrate with third parties and is necessary for developing platform models of banking regulators in a number of jurisdictions have begun mandating that banks share data and access with third party organizations via open apis these open banking standards such as psd in europe are expected to weaken banks control over customer data and allow customers much greater control over thirdparty access to their accounts margins on banking products are declining due to increased competition lowering the profitability of product manufacturing this incentivizes banks to refocus on distribution and seek partnerships with specialized product and service providers in effect creating platforms for their customers caveats uncertain economics platform banking business models are nascent and little is understood about what the model and economics will ultimately look like the uncertainty has discouraged incumbents and financial services software providers from investing in platform banking solutions particularly as the incremental scale required to offset potential cannibalization is unclear introduction findings a b c d uncertainties end states conclusion digital banking finding a traditional bank distribution models and economics are at risk of being deeply disrupted by the drive towards platform models of banking continued case studies quantitative evidence total number of publicly available apis on the programmableweb directory curated platform

download a wide range of functionalities which complement core products to do this the bank exposes its api to all external developers and cultivates a community that encourages customers to suggest ideas rise of apis in financial services key uncertainties the degree of platform openness will depend on how many regulators enforce open banking standards and how strongly they do so will other governments pass regulations requiring the open sharing of data will there be a hard or soft enforcement of psd absent regulatory pressures how strongly will banks seek to curate their platform offerings sources the investment observer american banker nordics apis introduction findings a b c d uncertainties end states conclusion digital banking finding b banks no longer define customer expectations of the banking experience instead fintechs and large technology companies set the standard experiences with nonincumbents are raising the bar for banks as customers expect more valuedriven personalized and seamless service than ever before incumbent banks focused on recapitalizing their postcrisis balance sheets are playing catchup supporting evidence client comfort with digital channels customers use of digital channels for banking has risen as adoption of smartphones and other internet enabled devices increases worldwide customers are also becoming more trusting of digital channels when conducting monetary transactions as illustrated by the global rise of online shopping experiences with non financial firms customers now demand the same immediate access frictionless experience and lowfee or free offerings from their mobile banking apps as they receive from uber starbucks and other leading mobile applications forcing banks to learn lessons from outside the banking ecosystem realworld costcutting as revenues plateau incumbent banks have sought to lower their costs by eliminating inperson services driving customers to lowercost channels and jettisoning unprofitable customer segments these efforts while necessary to maintain profitability have meant that banks have had to learn alternative methods of customer engagement wherever they can including from fintechs and large technology firms introduction findings a b c d uncertainties end states conclusion digital banking finding b banks no longer define customer expectations of the

how if at all will large tech firms move into the digital banking area how will the move to digital impact the attractiveness of mass and massaffluent clients sources the new york times the verge the boston consulting group introduction findings a b c d uncertainties end states conclusion digital banking finding c incumbents are starting to migrate core systems to the cloud as legacy infrastructure creates challenges in meeting customer needs banks have undertaken significant efforts to move to a newer cloudbased architecture but still struggle with legacy infrastructure that weighs down profits and limits banks ability to meet customer needs supporting evidence infrastructure issues core technological systems of financial institutions are largely built on decadesold infrastructure using extinct languages eg cobol and are riddled with inefficiencies as a result many incumbents are investing in integration layers to bridge the needs of clientfacing systems with their core system while these layers have proven valuable banks are also aware of the need to migrate away from legacy cores patchwork solutions startups are able to begin with the client experience and build an infrastructure specially designed for the client in contrast incumbent financial institutions must often build adhoc solutions to meet specific needs providing a shortterm solution but adding to the complexity of subsequent changes and the eventual modernization of their systems gradual shift to modernization incumbent financial institutions are shifting away from strategies to rip and replace legacy systems towards a gradual migration of functions to the cloud in order to improve flexibility and reduce costs however the process of migrating away from legacy systems will take years and large amounts of capital and may prompt reliability issues introduction findings a b c d uncertainties end states conclusion digital banking finding c incumbents are starting to migrate core systems to the cloud as legacy infrastructure creates challenges in meeting customer needs continued case studies quantitative evidence bb fintech focused on infrastructure mx provides modern external solutions to incumbents for data collection enrichment analysis and money management tools mx partnered with bbva to develop bbvas compass financial tools a suite of financial management and account aggregation tools key uncertainties migration to the cloud bank it spend in us by focus capital one has been a leader in migrating its core systems to the cloud it adopted a cloudbased infrastructure approach for all new applications by and in recent years has been focused on migrating its core systems to amazons aws platform with the aim of cutting over of its data centres by maintenance improvements maintenance of core information technology it systems in financial institutions represents of all it spending defining an overall longterm digital strategy requires incumbents to create compatibility and efficiency from the front to back end will the shift to cloudbased infrastructure create opportunities for a new data strategy how will the shift to new infrastructure affect data and privacy concerns will infrastructure strategies of financial institutions become more divergent in the long run sources pr newswire amazon web services the financial brand introduction findings a b c d uncertainties end states conclusion digital banking finding d few customers have moved away from traditional deposit accounts despite significant efforts from online and mobile challenger banks a number of these banks have appeared in recent years however these challenger banks have largely failed to gain market share especially with more profitable customer segments supporting evidence value of physical presence customers preferences are quickly shifting to digital channels but physical branches remain a critical component of the banking experience many customers have banking needs which only physical locations can currently fulfill eg getting a sameday wire transfer for a home purchase while other customers prefer a channel based on human interaction poor challenger bank economics because challenger banks are unable to meet more complex needs they tend to be used as secondary bank accounts by most customers causing them to lose out on a large share of revenue also to attract customers they often provide either lower fees or higher returns on deposits than incumbents both of which lower profitability incumbents targeting attractive customers ability to fast follow the profitability of many customer segments declined following the financial crisis as wealth levels fell and interest rates approached zero in response incumbents refocused their efforts on optimizing their client base retaining their most profitable customer segments and ensuring that only less profitable customers would be tempted to switch to challenger banks very few technological barriers to entry affect the development of an online or mobile challenger bank the majority of the barriers concern regulation thus if customer defections to challenger banks accelerate incumbents can quickly follow with visually appealing frontend offerings or an online bank of their own introduction findings a b c d uncertainties end states conclusion digital banking finding d few customers have moved away from traditional deposit accounts despite significant efforts from online and mobile challenger banks continued case studies quantitative evidence mini robobranch guide to digital banking bank of america recently tested the idea of automated branches by opening three mini bank branches that have atms and videoconferencing but no employees in addition to the atms the new robobanks called automated centres allow customers to make a videoconference call to a bank of america employee at another location santanders new walk out working wow initiative allows customers who open an account at a santander branch to set up their digital banking tools on site bank employees ensure that clients mobile and online accounts are fully activated and accessible on the first day so they can walk out working and are not tempted to switch key uncertainties average number of routine branch interactions per respondent us canada uk australia netherlands use of branches is declining but slowly incumbents are starting to embrace the new era of digitization while building on their core competitive advantages will platform banking aid challenger banks in their battle to become primary institutions how can digitalonly banks overcome their lack of physical locations as technology decreases the cost of serving clients will banks begin to retarget less desirable clients sources the washington post pr newswire bain company introduction findings a b c d uncertainties end states conclusion digital banking key uncertainties the future of digital banking will be impacted by the unravelling of uncertainties around regulation increasing digitization and the behaviour of technology giants what we know fintechs are now setting the level of expectations that customers have for banks with the emergence of platform banking models banks are trying to evolve but are weighed down by legacy systems however though fintechs may offer superior digital experiences consumers have yet to shift away from incumbent banks to online and mobile challenger banks through these findings the following uncertainties around digital banking emerged uncertainties will psd be a game changer for the industry in europe will customer interest in open banking models continue in light of growing cyberinsecurity what are the business models for large tech companies expanding into banking how can incumbent banks transfer their competitive advantages to the digital world what partners will banks choose to set out their longterm digital strategy possible futures the resolution of these five key uncertainties paints three diverging pictures of the future of the digital banking industry controlled curated platforms tech aggregation platforms open platform world introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion digital banking potential end states depending on how the key uncertainties are resolved the potential end states have very different evolutionary paths and implications for all firms controlled curated platforms tech aggregation platforms open platform world the first end state paints a world where banks outsource product design for less profitable products banks form collections of best ofbreed products from various sources customers benefit from diverse and customized offerings fintechs focus on whitelabel and cobranded products the second end state paints a world where large tech firms create distribution platforms fintechs and smaller banks extend partnerships with large tech firms customers embrace the ability to purchase from large tech firms incumbents are forced to decide whether to join tech platforms or stay isolated the third end state paints a world where legislation or customer pressure forces banks to use open apis third parties use apis to develop their own products new entrants directly compete with traditional bank products financial institutions choose to focus on single segments of the value chain introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion digital banking end state one as banks focus on costcutting they start embracing controlled curated platforms as a costeffective way of offering services as banks face margin pressures they make the decision to cut less profitable products and services in order to focus on differentiated offerings to fill the resulting gap banks approach fintechs and other service providers to form partnerships based on products over time banks form a small highly curated ecosystem of products and services based on customers partnerships with other organizations which they can then offer their customers benefit from access to bestofbreed offerings without having to switch banks but lack the choice they would have in an open platform critical conditions early signs banks are not forced to develop open data solutions by regulators banks make the decision to offer outside products to their customers instead of building inhouse product designers are willing to make partnerships with banks for greater access to customers banks form productlevel partnerships with fintechs to use the bank as a platform open data regulations are not broadly adopted or are weakly enforced introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion digital banking end state one controlled curated platforms give much greater power to the curator at the expense of customer choice implications for banks banks get to choose the areas of banking they want to specialize in and can offer other features to their customers via partnerships banks will need to ensure that they and their partners whether platforms or manufacturers provide a unified experience for customers implications for customers customers benefit from bestofbreed products but have less choice than in other platform end states customers face higher switching costs between product ecosystems controlled curated platforms implications for regulators regulators must closely consider the market power of platform owners to ensure they are not using their position to distort market forces regulators must also track the spread of customer data between platform owners and product manufacturers to ensure the data is handled and stored properly implications for fintechs fintechs can partner with banks to extend their reach but lose out on control over distribution fintechs can also use partnerships to broaden their suite of offerings and compete directly with banks more effectively introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion digital banking end state two as fintechs and banks seek partners to optimize their value chain large tech firms start hosting significant distribution platforms large tech firms enter the digital banking sector not as product owners but as product distributors using their preexisting platform fintechs and smaller banks especially those that focus on niches form distribution partnerships with tech platforms allowing those banks to maximize their potential customer base customers already used to interacting with the tech firm embrace those aggregation platforms making them a bestof breed and more agile alternative to the traditional fullservice banking model seeing the popularity of these platforms large banks have a difficult choice to make give up their exclusive distribution networks and join or risk missing out on a growing set of customers critical conditions early signs big tech players choose to enter the distribution side of financial services large tech players move upstream from infrastructure to providing software big tech players are not plagued by a major scandal or data breach and remain trustworthy to engage with regulators accept a more oligopolistic distribution of financial services products by tech firms more regulatory sandboxes begin to develop and allow firms like facebook to operate in the financial area tech firms eg facebook begin to offer simple financial services products backed by one or two partners introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion digital banking end state two large techs expand into the financial services area intensifying their customer relationships and challenging regulators in preserving competition implications for customers buying financial products from the tech provider of choice increases convenience for customers as the aggregation platforms represent a shelf of crossentity products comparability and thus product quality may decrease implications for regulators as the dominance of large tech firms extends into finance regulators need to consider the risk of market dominance even more strongly tech aggregation platforms implications for banks banks would face a retail competitor with potentially broader reach and more resources meaning they would have to find competitive advantages products and services previously bundled under the banking umbrella would become unbundled with only the regulated pieces staying with the bank implications for large tech firms large tech firms would significantly increase their access to customer data sets introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion digital banking end state three pressures force an open environment increasing competition and compelling incumbent institutions to focus on the most valuable segments banks are forced to develop and sell on open platforms as a result of open banking regulation or as consumers move to large tech platforms for the first time many third parties can compete directly against banks on a level playing field deploying products on the same platforms as banks do customers loyalty to a product provider falls as they shift to the banking product that suits them aided by the platforms guidance financial institutions must choose to become a platform operator or product manufacturer as owning the entire banking experience from product to distribution becomes difficult critical conditions early signs regulations force the development of open platforms newly created open platforms gain enough customer support to force incumbents to participate banks develop digital identity solutions and consistently deliver them customers embrace platform banking overcoming their stickiness to one provider regulators push back against the formation of closed curated platforms customers flock to the development of open distribution platforms perhaps created by large tech firms fintechs appear that are only focused on product design introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion digital banking end state three power dynamics are shifting due to a more fragmented value chain as customers are benefitting significantly from increasing competition implications for banks banks would be pushed to decide what role they wanted to play in the value chain product distributor or platform manager banks would lose the ability to cross subsidize any of their products and thus would have to ensure profitability product by product open platforms would mean that brand image becomes even more important than before and banks would have an advantage implications for customers as the market becomes more competitive and clientcentric customers would be the main beneficiaries however customers may be confused and overwhelmed by the choice of products implications for regulators as legislations open up the playing field regulators need to clarify regulations for and grow comfortable with a materially different business model the shift to open platforms raises the question of who is liable the distributor or the product owner implications for new entrants open platforms allow fintechs to bypass the problem of scale as platforms can provide access to many customers new entrants without strong branding must find ways for their products to stand out open platform world introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion digital banking conclusion key takeaways for financial institutions distributors or manufacturers the rise of product platforms in digital banking will force market participants to make a choice between a strategic focus on product distribution ie becoming the platform or a focus on product manufacturing this choice will have farreaching implications for their businesses and customer interaction models as well as for their competitive landscape fewer bigger winners the advantage of being the market leader will increase significantly for both product manufacturers and product distributors platforms will offer customers improved transparency into products significantly increasing the advantage for the best products for distributors significant economies of scale in access to data and customer awareness will feed a virtuous cycle of growth ecosystem imperatives under all possible end states digital banking institutions will forge more relationships with other financial services and increasingly nonfinancial services firms meaning that within the digital banking ecosystem a proficiency for establishing partnerships and a willingness to create winwin symbiotic relationships will lead to more partners introduction

techniques have proven valuable in adjudicating credit especially for thinfile customers with insufficient credit bureau history to qualify for most loans driving a rapid expansion of credit to underserved markets supporting evidence new sources of data new sources of data have emerged for use in adjudicating credit such as social and mobile data for individuals and payments or accounting data for businesses while this data has had limited effectiveness in improving the underwriting of established customers it has proven to be valuable for thinfile borrowers with insufficient credit bureau history and small businesses using data more effectively incumbent lenders are looking to their existing stores of data to bolster their underwriting models especially for underbanked customers however that data is often unstructured and siloed making it difficult to be put to use to address these challenges incumbents are investing heavily in data transformation automation and new analytics more agile credit models new entrants improve on their credit models using short iteration cycles while incumbents are constrained to making adjustments much more slowly this lag in implementing bestinclass methodologies provides new entrants a temporary competitive advantage in understanding the credit risk of underbanked and thinfile customers especially as new sources of data become available caveats lack of credit cycles while credit models have improved since the financial crisis many alternative approaches were developed following the crisis making it unclear how alternative

smallbusiness borrowers expect their lender to deliver the seamless digital origination and rapid adjudication pioneered by leading fintechs new fintechs ability to deliver faster and less onerous application processes is placing pressure on incumbents to deliver similarly streamlined experiences supporting evidence improved processes new online lenders have cut loan adjudication times to minutes forcing incumbent lenders to improve and automate internal loan processes in order to compete as a result many loan processes that previously needed human intervention are now autoadjudicated allowing incumbents to offer digital origination and rapid loan origination legacy technology increasing costs constrained by decadesold mainframes incumbents must add technological bridges to connect legacy infrastructure with the digital front ends demanded by customers this additional effort increases development time and costs compared to fintechs but is necessary for incumbents to compete partnerships as costsaver improving processes and building middleware have both proven to be relatively expensive incumbents have thus looked at partnerships with marketplace lenders allowing them to

nonfinancial platforms are emerging as an important source of underwriting data and a point of distribution for credit new distribution channels are being created as financial institutions embed lending products into thirdparty online platforms as they seek to capture customers in moments of need nonfinancial institutions are also jumping into the fray supporting evidence increasing customer engagement lenders are targeting nonfinancial platforms because they provide access to the exact moments when customers need credit the most such as during supply chain management or the settlement of accounts receivable thus lenders can preemptively underwrite loans at decision moments increasing data collection lenders are also turning to nonfinancial platforms as distribution channel partners because of the particular data sets many of these platforms hold this data can provide valuable forwardlooking insights into a companys performance as well as enable detailed comparisons between similar businesses and individuals as such this data helps to lower both underwriting risk and the cost of underwriting risk of new entrants nonfinancial platforms have also begun their own exploration into providing lending products directly to their users as a new line of business whether these loans are funded directly from the platforms balance sheet or via a funding partner they represent direct competition with financial institutions for credit distribution introduction findings a b c d uncertainties end states conclusion lending finding c nonfinancial platforms are emerging

to dramatically shift the balance of power towards customer platforms how can financial institutions create a symbiotic lending relationship with nonfinancial platforms sources techspot city am what is stopping other non financial platforms from offering their own lending products are there other nonfinancial platforms that make sense as an origination vehicle introduction findings a b c d uncertainties end states conclusion lending finding d funding economics put marketplace lenders at a cost disadvantage compared to traditional banks raising questions about the models sustainability despite operating cost advantages marketplace lenders suffer from higher funding costs creating challenges in pricesensitive segments and forcing them to explore other models supporting evidence high customer acquisition costs building a client base from scratch has proved to be expensive for new entrants particularly where they have relied on highcost analog channels such as direct mail these higher customer acquisition costs have created particular challenges in segments where incumbents are well established and margins are low as incumbents already have a welldefined client base and therefore a large cost advantage high funding costs for marketplaces while the absence of a branch network creates certain cost advantages for new entrants they are more than offset by significantly higher funding costs than for banks while incumbent banks are able to deploy lowcost deposits new entrants have relied on private investors who demand higher premiums to reflect a higher credit risk perceived or otherwise and a lesserknown brand funding instability maintaining liquidity in a twosided marketplace has proved to be difficult marketplaces initially sought hedge fund capital to fund growth but found this capital to be unstable as hedge funds pulled back due to broader market volatility in response marketplaces are now exploring alternatives including acquiring banking licences which would give them access to lowercost funding sources such as demand deposits introduction findings a b c d uncertainties end states conclusion lending finding d funding economics put marketplace lenders at a cost disadvantage compared to traditional banks raising questions about the models sustainability continued case studies quantitative evidence major institutional funding prosper marketplace closed a deal in february with a consortium of institutional investors to purchase up to billion of loans through the lender over the following months the deal included warrants to purchase of the lenders equity highlighting its desire to secure long term funding key uncertainties online lender seeking deposit licence sofi a major us online lender focused on student and mortgage loans applied for a banking licence in june to diversify funding the move comes after similar actions by several other major lenders including zopa the united kingdoms first online lender total cost of attracting funds in uk current vs normalized in basis points bps bps base rate banks banks online lenders online lenders normalized normalized current current opex online lenders pay more to attract funds especially in a normalized environment funding costs return to investors a strategy of funding diversification and cost optimization is critical to marketplace lenders but it blurs the line with traditional banking will marketplace lenders be able to drive down their funding cost sufficiently to compete for price sensitive clients how will marketplace lenders attract deposits if they become banks how will marketplace lenders resolve their funding instability issues sources the wall street journal techcrunch cnbc deloitte introduction findings a b c d uncertainties end states conclusion lending key uncertainties five key uncertainties arise from the lending findings which will shape this industrys direction what we know the lending findings illustrate how fintechs have altered customer perception of the lending experience fintechs are using data to provide customers with painfree lending services and customers want the same efficient seamless experience with their banks additionally consumers can choose from a multitude of financial and nonfinancial providers however fintechs are struggling to find a sustainable business model in the face of funding instability through these findings the following uncertainties around lending emerged uncertainties how much more effective will underwriting become with new sources of data and analytical techniques will platformbased lending emerge to become a relevant distribution channel what is the long term impact of marketplace lenders licensing their underwriting technology will marketplace lenders move to provide direct lending how will the borrowers preference of distribution channels continue to evolve possible futures the resolution of these five key uncertainties paints three diverging pictures of the future of the lending industry different evolutionary paths shared service providers distribution introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion lending potential end states depending on how the key uncertainties are resolved the potential end states have very different evolutionary paths and implications for all firms different evolutionary paths shared service providers distribution the first end state paints a world where marketplace lenders are challenged as funding costs rise marketplaces further specialize and target niche areas other marketplace lenders seek to become banks customers benefit especially in niche areas the second end state paints a world where certain marketplace lenders become bb service providers banks find service providers more capable and cost effective than their own internal functions service providers flourish and become indispensable the industrys cost base becomes commoditized the third end state paints a world where lenders form partnerships with nonfinancial firms nonfinancial firms use their platforms to originate loans lenders begin to offer more customized products using additional data consumers benefit from loans at the point of need introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion lending end state one marketplace lenders have to further develop sophisticated capabilities or compete on price with established banks marketplace lenders are challenged in their attempts to scale up as their former competitive advantages of commoditized speed service and underwriting accuracy are some marketplace lenders shift their focus to niche products and to clients currently underserved by large banks other marketplace lenders choose to compete head on with established banks acquiring banking licences and retail deposits to lower and stabilize their funding costs as a result the marketplace lending model evolves itself away as firms either chase niche markets become banks or go out of business entirely critical conditions early signs marketplace lenders fail to emerge as dominant players in non niche markets incumbent banks are able to sufficiently lower operating costs quickly enough to outperform marketplace lenders the growth of marketplace lenders continues to be weak some marketplace lenders expand into new products and customer segments other marketplace lenders shift to acquire banking licences introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion lending end state one clients will benefit from more sophisticated niche lending and increased competition as the lending landscape becomes more fragmented implications for incumbents competition increases for niche areas but overall competition decreases as marketplace lenders become less competitive marketplace lenders become a regular venue for banks to deploy excess capital implications for regulators awareness is required of risks stemming from increased consolidation as incumbents gain market share regulators must define the rules for edge cases as lending firms try to adapt their business model becoming more like a bank different evolutionary paths implications for alternative lenders alternative lenders have access to much smaller sections of the market as they cede market share to banks convergence with digital banking fintechs could lead to increased competition significant growth occurs across new niche markets implications for customers customers benefit from expanded availability of credit to underserved markets introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion lending end state two the desire for costcommoditization drives growth in bb service providers as two needs come together in one solution offering faster loans and leveraging nontraditional underwriting methods marketplace lenders shift customer expectations on what to expect from the loan experience however marketplace lenders largely fail to gain sufficient scale to overcome their considerable disadvantages in funding costs and struggle to remain viable meanwhile banks operating on expensive legacy cost bases with limited capabilities find partnerships with service providers to be the best delivery approach as a result some marketplace lenders choose to work with banks as bb service providers and banks outsource the majority of their lending technology to marketplace lenders critical conditions early signs regulators buy in to sharedservice models between competitors a critical mass of financial institutions using shared service and external providers is reached lending margins continue to erode specialized capability providers that successfully deliver absolute cost advantages proliferate connectivity between capability providers and banks becomes standardized businesses develop adjacent to shared services eg rating agencies for vendors introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion lending end state two increasing externalization improves industry cost bases but creates potential new points of systemic risk implications for incumbents externalization leads to significant reductions of inhouse middle and back office functions many inhouse capabilities that have set apart banks from competition are no longer differentiators increased capacity from softwareasa service providers makes it expenditures more of a variable cost decreasing the benefits of scale implications for regulators the rise in bb providers potentially increases the systemic risk of a single point of failure granularity increases and service providers face more intense regulatory scrutiny shared service providers implications for alternative lenders as lenders business models move from bc to bb the capabilities required for success shift significantly nonfinancial firms expand into lending as barriers to entry fall potentially leading to a return to the era of personal credit issued by retailers implications for customers more competition on service and costs as highquality execution becomes commoditized lower loan costs as bank operating expenses decrease market fragmentation drives an intense battle for mindshare introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion lending end state three nonfinancial firms move horizontally into financial services and disintermediate the traditional broker channel as lending becomes commoditized lenders look for new opportunities to acquire potential customers and high quality data on their current customers lenders form partnerships with non financial platforms to use their data and offer loans through their user interfaces lenders improve the sophistication of their underwriting using their partners data to make highly targeted offers that anticipate customer needs nonfinancial platforms effectively replace the traditional broker channel and derive additional customer loyalty from having customers locked in to their ecosystem critical conditions early signs connectivity between the nonfinancial firm and the bank allows banks to receive data from and to offer loans through the platform data provided by nonfinancial firms is considered better than from other sources in adjudicating credit small and mediumsized businesses increasingly adopt cloudbased software solutions more nonfinancial firms begin to move into the financial services area either on their own or through partnerships with existing lenders introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion lending end state three as partnerships between banks and nonfinancial firms proliferate customers experience improves and choices become numerous implications for incumbents the rise of platforms as intermediaries means incumbents move further away from their customers some platforms may act as aggregators and allow for comparisons thereby increasing price competition incumbents acquire a better understanding of clients as they gain access to a new and deeper pool of non financial data implications for regulators regulators need to monitor new non financial distribution channels and potentially regulate previously unregulated parties distribution implications for nonfinancial firms such firms develop a new source of revenue as platforms receive fees in exchange for access and data they proactively provide funding to clients directly inapp thereby increasing customer interaction and providing more pull into the platform the firms have a deeper relationship with their banks and more bargaining power in negotiations implications for customers customers benefit from an improved experience loans are available directly in app and customers know in advanced whether they are approved customers have improved comparability of financial products and access to multiple providers introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion lending conclusion key takeaways for financial institutions the lowest funding costs win despite innovations in origination and adjudication the online lending model is fundamentally limited by high and unstable funding costs in its ability to compete with banks the need for a consistent funding source at a cost similar to that of deposits for banks will drive online lenders to acquire banking licences unless an alternative funding source can be found lending goes digital marketplace lenders and technology firms have reoriented customer expectations leading lenders are expected to offer simple credit origination experiences where a combination of design and automation provides customers with a frictionless application experience and a swift response lenders use data effectively leading lenders are using data to improve both the effectiveness and the efficiency of their adjudication processes they employ new sources of data to underwrite applications whose risks could not previously be assessed eg thinfile customers and reduce underwriting costs by automating the collection and analysis of key data eg using data collected directly from a smallbusiness accounting platform moving forward lenders will increasingly look for new signalsdata to inform lending decisions introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion lending

management world economic forum investment management introduction investment management has greatly evolved in the last several years this section examines the key trends shaping the industry and the uncertain path forward the first half of this decade was marked by profound changes to the investment management industry including the entry of several major forces that held the potential to fundamentally shift the industrys course circa the major forces impacting investment management were the rise of roboadvisors big datadriven analysis increasing bb externalization automated advisers that use trading formulas based on lowfee etfs were capturing attention fintechs were beginning to tap into the potential of big data for investments firms were starting to outsource back office processes such as regulatory monitoring circa the big uncertainties about the future of investment management were was roboadvisory service truly the right answer for the vast majority of customers how would companies look at bb externalization as margins continued to decline would monoline fintechs be able to capture significant market share note wealth managers are defined as organizations that provide advice and distribute products to customers in investment management asset managers are companies that manufacture the financial product itself which forms the basis for the investment introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion investment management overview of findings four trends in the investment management industry have shaped its future and incumbents not innovators look poised to benefit where did disruption occur a b c as individuals become more responsible for their investments robodistribution has become the most compelling tool for customer engagement scaling the delivery of investment advice requires fewer resources as middle and back office functions are increasingly being automated or externalized the growth of lowcost products has increased the importance of scale in product manufacturing driving pressures for consolidation where has disruption not occurred d new entrants to investment management have struggled to gain market share in the face of customer stickiness and high customer acquisition costs introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion investment management finding a as individuals become more responsible for their investments robodistribution has become the most compelling tool for customer engagement as employers abandon traditional defined benefit db plans in favour of defined contribution dc plans individuals are becoming more responsible for managing their own investments driving a need for lowcost investments and advice on asset allocation supporting evidence shift from institutional to individual baby boomers are drawing down on defined benefit plans guaranteed benefits while younger workers are predominantly limited to defined contribution investment plans benefits based on investment returns these trends are increasing the share of total investments that are selfmanaged driving demand for products and services targeted to individuals as opposed to institutional investors increasing regulation raising costs regulators have stepped up efforts to protect retail investors citing misselling scandals rising investor dissatisfaction and the shifting of retirement burdens from institutions to individuals an unintended consequence of these polices has been to increase the cost of providing customers with individualized offerings through traditional channels making roboadvisors a compelling solution rising client expectations customers have become accustomed to customercentric offerings and service in nonfinancial settings and expect their financial services experiences including wealth management to exhibit similar characteristics roboadvisory products offer a digital and customercentric experience at a low cost and are thus attractive particularly for younger customers introduction findings a b c d uncertainties end states conclusion investment management finding a as individuals become more responsible for their investments robodistribution has become the most compelling tool for customer engagement continued case studies quantitative evidence roboadvisory product for the masses charles schwab has rolled out its

bespoke services how will firms differentiate their roboadvisory offerings from similar offerings throughout the industry how far will regulators push in mandating transparency and fiduciary duty in advice how will a prolonged period of low market returns continue to shift industry economics sources charles schwab investopedia forbes deloitte casey quirk introduction findings a b c d uncertainties end states conclusion investment management finding b scaling the delivery of investment advice requires fewer resources as middle and back office functions are increasingly being automated or externalized asset and wealth managers are seeing margins decline and are turning to externalization and automation to lower costs as noncore functions become externalized and commoditized the industry value chain threatens to shift considerably supporting evidence margin compression forcing costcutting growth in external service providers manufacturing margins are declining as demand shifts from highcost to lowcost products and distribution margins are falling as roboadvisors gain popularity this pressure is driving incumbents to search for savings especially in the areas of the value chain that add the least value the middle and back office enabled by technological advancements external service providers are growing and building a track record of success in driving efficiency as these firms proliferate and allow asset managers to focus on the strategic aspects of investing they will be trusted with more and more functions that are central to the asset managers operations automation and ai replacing processes automation and ai are becoming more capable and may soon be able to replace complex human activities across the front middle and back office as they do so competitive advantages derived from excellence in process execution will deteriorate leading to even more process externalization introduction findings a b c d uncertainties end states

the balance between automating and maintaining manual processes how does commoditization of back office functions affect an institutions ability to differentiate itself how does the division of regulatory responsibilities change as functions are externalized sources cnbc robinhood finextra introduction findings a b c d uncertainties end states conclusion investment management finding c the growth of lowcost products has increased the importance of scale in product manufacturing driving pressures for consolidation as the demand for lowcost investments grows utilizing economies of scale to lower product costs and offering differentiated products at low cost become major competitive priorities supporting evidence alpha becoming more elusive for asset managers excess returns over the market alpha have proven elusive to generate in the post crisis environment making it difficult for managers to justify their higher fees and diminishing their appeal in favour of lowcost products low fees high economies of scale as the popularity of lowcost products has grown providers have primarily competed on the basis of price with the lowestcost us equity etf charging just three basis points this significant advantage of scale in the production of lowcost products means industry consolidation is inevitable rise of smart beta the growth of lowcost etf products has created a gap in the market for investors that are attracted to active strategies but are also looking for low costs as a result smart beta products that employ active strategies but use lowcost beta products have risen in popularity and are also helping to drive the push for additional scale to lower costs introduction findings a b c d uncertainties end states conclusion investment management finding c the growth of lowcost products has increased the importance of scale in product manufacturing driving pressures for consolidation continued case studies passive products as competitive advantage consolidation of humanmanaged funds as an early proponent of index funds vanguard has benefited greatly from the ongoing shift to lowcost investments while its competition grapples with declining margins vanguard

investment management have struggled to gain market share in the face of customer stickiness and high customer acquisition costs incumbents have quickly coopted the roboadvisory model driving monoline roboadvisors to explore new business models such as licensing their technology to incumbents supporting evidence challenging percustomer economics monoline roboadvisors have primarily attracted mass or massaffluent customers coupled with their low fees these clients generate relatively low percustomer revenue these economics have proven challenging as customer acquisition costs are high relative to each customers value making it difficult to be profitable low barriers to entry roboadvisory offerings have proven to be relatively quick and economical to develop the low cost of entry has allowed incumbent wealth managers to fast follow new entrants and build their own offerings which they can then offer to their existing customer base to keep customer acquisition costs low value added services traditional wealth management services are becoming commoditized as new entrants automate advice and cash flow management services however this commoditization has underscored that clients value highly intangible human capabilities and bespoke services especially as they increase in net worth incumbents ability to provide these services can foster customer stickiness introduction

buy or partner to offer roboadvice how can wealth managers differentiate their roboadvisory offerings sources forbes macquarie charles schwab business insider business insider forbes bloomberg investopedia introduction findings a b c d uncertainties end states conclusion investment management key uncertainties uncertainties in investment management largely revolve around the nature of future investment products and the composition of the related value chain what we know these findings illustrate increasing client expectations and the importance of a personalized customer experience as middle and back office functions are automated or externalized firms are forced to differentiate on highquality process execution and distinct tailored advice customer stickiness and the high cost of new customer acquisition allow incumbents to benefit as successful fintech offerings such as roboadvisors are quick and easy to replicate through these findings the following uncertainties around investment management emerged uncertainties to what degree will product manufacturers move upstream and disrupt distributors how will wealth managers differentiate their roboadvisory offerings will clients continue to prefer lowcost investments or will guaranteed outcome products become popular how will the role of human advisers and their job requirements change will product manufacturing be characterized by more or less scale possible futures the resolution of these five key uncertainties paints three diverging pictures of the future of the investment management industry certaintybased offerings advice as a differentiator quality externalization introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion investment management potential end states depending on how the key uncertainties are resolved the potential end states have very different evolutionary paths and implications for all firms certaintybased offerings advice as a differentiator quality externalization the first end state paints a world where retail clients have less access to traditional pensions retail clients become a more attractive segment than institutional clients roboadvisors condition clients to expect certainty asset management develops and delivers guaranteed outcome products the second end state paints a world where clients especially millennials flock to roboadvisors algorithmdriven interfaces expand across multiple asset categories wealth becomes the primary point of interaction with financial institutions datasharing agreements become much more important to understand consumers the third end state paints a world where more and more cloud and platformasaservice providers emerge benefits of scale erode as high quality execution becomes the norm much of the market gets consolidated into large firms that can afford differentiated technology many specialized smaller wealth managers thrive by appealing to niche markets introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion investment management end state one growing profit pools in retail wealth lead to a renaissance of products guaranteeing a predefined outcome because of competition and a shift to lowcost products lower margins on the institutional side drive the industry to increase its focus on individual investors employers shift to defined contribution programmes combined with the growth of the selfemployment economy means more people lack certainty about their retirement while calculators and visualizations may create the perception of certainty in the customers mind traditional products still depend on market conditions and thus lack certainty wealth managers compete by delivering guaranteed or semiguaranteed products designed to offer increased certainty to customers critical conditions early signs improvements in analytics and risk management provide more granular insights into the liabilities associated with guaranteed products institutions and manufacturers would need to be comfortable taking risk on some balance sheets and holding capital against it an operating model for breaking down barriers between insurance and wealth managementbanking is accepted by regulators the shift of pensions from defined benefit to defined contribution continues partnerships form between product manufacturers insurers and gigeconomy firms introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion investment management end state one customers will profit from products offering increased certainty but strong partnerships are needed to manage risks implications for customers products that offer guaranteed outcomes increase customer certainty about retirement predefined and guaranteed outcomes prevent severe losses and are thus better options for riskaverse individuals the duality of goalbased and valuebased propositions creates different segments of clients implications for wealth managers the increasing importance of individual clients requires significant investment to distribute via mobileonline channels human factors eg synthesis decision making are becoming more important certaintybased offerings implications for asset managers individual demands allow product development and brand to become more important the offering of guaranteebased products makes proprietary risk management practices a key differentiator increased risk requires stronger collaboration with wealth managers distribution and insurers risk management implications for regulators the offering of guaranteebased products requires corresponding regulation and supervision more individual decisionmaking requires more comprehensive financial education introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion investment management end state two based on significant improvements in roboadvice investment advice becomes the primary driver of a clients choice of institution as the entire industry embraces roboadvisors firms increasingly find it difficult to differentiate their offerings startups in particular struggle due to the lack of a strong brand wealth managers look to differentiate their robo advisors to capture additional market share including offering more sophisticated services such as cash flow management enhanced roboadvisors touch all aspects of an individuals financial health from loan repayments to insurance product selection as a result the enhanced automated adviser becomes the primary point of interaction for a client and the primary driver of a clients choice of institution critical conditions early signs the capabilities of roboadvisors eg cash flow management are significantly improved interoperability is established between products and services to allow for managing them through a single enhanced roboadvisory system advisers are able to secure access to a full view of relevant customer data including external data core banking margins narrow increasing the relative importance of wealth management business units as a profit driver and a differentiator the number of partnerships and acquisitions between incumbent institutions and roboadvisors or other technology providers increases further introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion investment management end state two investment services will become more convenient but also less transparent for customers while the role of wealth managers becomes more critical implications for customers sophisticated roboadvisors coupled with customized advice and services improve experiences and outcomes for digitally savvy customers the relationship with financial institutions becomes servicebased instead of product based implications for wealth managers highly automated aidriven advice requires significant investment in system integration for information core competencies shift from process execution to more human factors eg synthesis decisionmaking the importance of data will lead to a focus on thirdparty datasharing agreements advice as a differentiator implications for asset managers power dynamics shift away from manufacturers and towards distributors as they control the customer relationship and mindshare implications for regulators the need to interpret and regulate behaviour of algorithms and ai in the retail area increases especially regarding recommendations introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion investment management end state three increasing cost pressures force firms to either rely on external service providers or gain the scale to invest in differentiated technology investor demand for low cost advice and products accelerates driving down average revenue rates and incentivizing asset and wealth managers to lower operating costs external service providers quickly proliferate as they demonstrate success in lowering costs and improving capabilities external service providers mean small and large players have access to the same capabilities this erodes the benefits of scale except for the very largest firms who can invest in differentiated technology the industry bifurcates into small firms that aggressively pursue niches and giants that leverage differentiated technology to offer superior products and experiences to the mass market critical conditions early signs capability providers demonstrate the ability to offer similar levels of service at substantially lower cost regulators are comfortable with increased outsourcing of core business functions capability providers exhibit the necessary level of interoperability to make externalization efficient incumbents are comfortable with cloudplatformasaservice solutions increasing numbers of utilities or bb capability providers emerge incumbents partner with capability providers as opposed to acquiring them introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion investment management end state three increasing standardization and industry bifurcation create new opportunities as well as new threats for all industry stakeholders implications for customers the emergence of sophisticated capability providers increases the speed of and reduces errors in client onboarding asset management products as well as interactions with distributors become undifferentiated from a customer perspective implications for wealth managers the use of capability providers makes middle and back office functions more efficient the reduced ability to differentiate based on process means scale becomes a major differentiator quality externalization implications for asset managers human capital needs and organizational structure will change in order to manage a portfolio of capabilities as opposed to a portfolio of talent the use of capability providers makes middle and back office functions more efficient the ability to differentiate based on process is reduced as externalization becomes an imperative implications for regulators visibility increases due to natural standardization created by externalization the potential for systemic risk created by single points of failure needs to be contained introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion investment management conclusion key takeaways for financial institutions differentiation of offering the ongoing industrywide automation and externalization of middle and back offices combined with the ubiquity of roboadvisory offerings are commoditizing the investment advisory value proposition consequently leading firms will seek to identify and invest in other ways of differentiating themselves to stand apart from competition in particular through deeper personalization of customer offerings advicedriven customer guidance as roboadvisors become more ubiquitous and more sophisticated leading investment management companies will look to use these capabilities to deepen their engagement with roboadvisory customers drawing on new sources of data to deliver advice on all aspects of their financial lives this will mark the start of a change in their role from roboinvestors to true roboadvisors role of human advisers the human adviser will still be crucial when differentiating products especially for highnetwealth customers but the role of such advisers will shift in leading companies from product selection to a focus on customer engagement emotional intelligence and decision support introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion investment management references references schwab intelligent portfolios charles schwab retrieved from

where has disruption not occurred c d the crowd has proven less wise than expected highlighting the need for further education and commercial due diligence tools to assist investors equity crowdfunding remains disconnected from the broader financial system limiting its longterm scalability introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion equity crowdfunding finding a crowdfunding platforms have grown rapidly driven by strong demand from both investors and entrepreneurs the venture fundraising market is more competitive than ever driven by a growing number of startups and private market investors seeking alternatives to venture capital supporting evidence strong private market returns established startups finding a more liquid venture capital market are choosing to remain private for longer to avoid burdensome disclosures and market scrutiny this delay has resulted in greater returns flowing to private investors ultimately driving others to look for opportunities to participate in the area low seedstage funding rates venture capitalists are paying more attention to the growing pool of private companies with valuations above billion and overlooking smaller firms creating a strong need for seed capital from individuals rise in entrepreneurship shifting attitudes towards entrepreneurship and the availability of new technologies that lower barriers to entry for startups have resulted in an explosion in the number of techbased startups driving the need for additional sources of funding introduction findings a b c d uncertainties

this affect venture capital firms sources seedrs blog angellist casey quirk analysis introduction findings a b c d uncertainties end states conclusion equity crowdfunding finding b the quality of regulation has been a defining factor in the success of the equity crowdfunding ecosystem new regulations around the globe are helping to structure and add transparency to the crowdfunding industry as regulators attempt to balance investor protection with a desire to make platforms an attractive and accessible source of capital supporting evidence relaxed suitability requirements many regulators are encouraging the industry by relaxing private market suitability requirements to allow nonaccredited investors to participate this ensures that limits against investment sizes and wealth levels do not unreasonably limit the pool of potential capital differing disclosure requirements regulators have generally taken a lighttouch approach with respect to disclosure requirements allowing for a process significantly less onerous than for public firms however certain jurisdictions have imposed harsher rules deteriorating the caliber of startups on platforms as only those truly desperate for capital put themselves through such a process regulatory divergence crowdfunding regulations have diverged globally as different jurisdictions view equity crowdfunding very differently and thus treat its risk profile differently this hampers the ability of platforms to expand and operate internationally limited deal size regulators have capped deal sizes to allow platforms to lead seed and a rounds if set too low these risks significantly reduce crowdfundings value to entrepreneurs seeking larger funding rounds introduction findings b b c d uncertainties end states conclusion equity

finding c the crowd has proven less wise than expected highlighting the need for further education and commercial due diligence tools to assist investors the crowd has driven valuations higher than those seen in venture capital markets creating the risk that investors become disillusioned due to disappointing returns in the future supporting evidence lack of resources and time unlike angel and venture capital investors crowdfunding platforms do not have the institutional knowledge and time to invest a sizeable amount of effort in due diligence instead performing simpler diligence and relying on the wisdom of the crowd inexperienced investors many large platforms allow nonaccredited investors to participate in equity fundraising those inexperienced investors drive valuations high in early rounds and are more likely to invest in less viable startups creating problems in later rounds moreover investors personal affiliations with brands can often play an outsized role in their investment decisions ai and cognitive solutions there is strong interest in leveraging new forms of data and the powers of automation and ai to perform commercial due diligence analogous to the credit

disconnected from the broader financial system limiting its longterm scalability although crowdfunding is an increasingly meaningful part of the sme funding landscape its momentum has recently slowed to sustain growth platforms need to broaden their distribution strategies to institutional funding supporting evidence limited track records due to the immaturity of the platforms and the lack of an established track record investors have limited ability to gauge the risks and return expectations of their investments thus they are reluctant to invest or in many jurisdictions are limited by investor protection laws lack of liquid secondary markets earlystage venture capital investments are highly illiquid with investors unable to realize a return until the company goes public or is sold often years after the initial investment a liquid secondary market would allow investors an opportunity to exit it also creates signaling issues for the startups as stock temporarily trading down could impact the businesss prospect of raising future rounds of investment demand for pooled products researching and investing in individual stocks is largely a cottage industry for retail investors as the majority of individuals desire the simplicity and accessibility of pooled products platforms have not yet developed more accessible products and could work with asset managers to do so wider

findings b c d d uncertainties end states conclusion equity crowdfunding key uncertainties five uncertainties will determine to what degree the industry can demonstrate stability and legitimacy while continuing to grow what we know the four equity crowdfunding findings illustrate the rise in demand for crowdfunding platforms the imperative role of regulation on crowdfunding success the challenges faced with the lack of investor knowledge and the difficulty of equity crowdfunding to integrate into the broader financial ecosystem through these findings the following key uncertainties around the future of equity crowdfunding emerged uncertainties how can platforms use emerging technologies eg ai and machine learning to educate investors and provide due diligence tools what partnerships are important to developing new products and expanding distribution how will regulators balance investor protection with ensuring that platforms remain an attractive source of capital how will rates of entrepreneurship evolve as macroeconomic conditions change and industries mature will shifting market conditions eg rising interest rates significantly impact investor demand for earlystage equity possible futures the resolution of these five key uncertainties paints three diverging pictures of the future of the equity crowdfunding industry social driver international expansion shooting star introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion equity crowdfunding potential end states depending on how the key uncertainties are resolved the potential end states have very different evolutionary paths and implications for all firms social driver international expansion shooting star the first end state paints a world where equity crowdfunding for profit oriented companies never achieves profitability social impactoriented crowdfunding builds on the success of debt instruments like social impact bonds platforms differentiate themselves based on social returns and affinity groups projects get sources of community support and feedback the second end state paints a world where regulations across jurisdictions are standardized platforms start expanding internationally new technologies allow inter platform connectivity secondary market trading allows platforms to attract additional investors and grow the third end state paints a world where continued low interest rate environments drive wealth managers to seek yield partnerships with equity crowdfunding platforms are developed ai and automation is used to analyse firms and investments the crowdfunding market grows considerably as institutional money arrives introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion equity crowdfunding end state one platforms fail to scale in profitoriented industries but catch on as vehicles to deliver social impact equity crowdfunding for profitoriented companies never rivals venture capital and angel investors however it catches on as a way of investing in equity for socially worthwhile causes unable to scale platforms never become profitable but get government support through grants and tax programmes platforms differentiate themselves based on degrees of social and financial returns and their affinity group as well as on customer engagement and degree of due diligence social projects get valuable community support and feedback allowing the ecosystem to flourish critical conditions early signs venture capital funds remain the dominant source of earlystage startup funding the number of investors interested in providing equity to social enterprises grows government support for platforms continues through grants and tax advantages high valuations andor poor track records stifle platform growth and drive investors away from the industry poor equity crowdfunding regulations are not fixed quality startups turn away from the crowdfunding platform and opt for venture capital funding instead introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion equity crowdfunding end state one social enterprises attract more funding and are more impactful as the ecosystem becomes developed and dedicated social driver implications for individual investors implications for incumbents implications for entrepreneurs individual investors receive access to a platform to invest equity in social causes they truly care about they give valuable input to affinity and socialfocused projects that other sources of investment do not provide angel investors and venture capital firms remain the dominant source of investment for private equity startups providing a social good have increased access to capital startups operating in less popular sectors for venture capital have fewer funding sources andor are located in less liquid venture capital markets introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion equity crowdfunding end state two regulator convergence allows for crossborder investment and crowdfunding platform growth obvious market success in certain jurisdictions driven by regulation drives regulators in other jurisdictions to follow suit and standardize equity crowdfunding rules platforms start expanding internationally allowing investors in one jurisdiction to invest in others thereby increasing the pool of potential investors for the top startups platforms invest in technologies that allow for interplatform connectivity and safe recordkeeping in order to encourage cross platform investments with the markets growth a nascent secondary market can even be established for the most successful crowdfunded firms critical conditions early signs increased collaboration between crowdfunding platforms and regulators across jurisdictions will help create standardized regulation for equity crowdfunding investment in technology leads to building interplatform connectivity and due diligence tools for investors increased pressure to regulate the industry results in new regulations and improved investor confidence in platforms interest grows for firms in emerging markets to use crowdfunding because of limited venture capital opportunities and for investors in mature markets to invest in them new tools emerge that allow investors to conduct due diligence introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion equity crowdfunding end state two international expansion by crowdfunding platforms levels access to venture capital across geographies international expansion implications for individual investors implications for incumbents implications for entrepreneurs investors have increased access to both domestic and global equity opportunities portfolio diversification is improved by adding highrisk and potentially high return global investments the number of laterstage emerging market investment opportunities available to venture capital funds grows as equity crowdfunding supports firms through earlystage growth increased competition for venture capital firms is focused on underdeveloped markets improved access to earlystage capital in markets traditionally underserved by venture capital levels the playing field between established and emerging markets introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion equity crowdfunding end state three crowdfunding platforms forge partnerships and gain scale to successfully lead latestage offerings traditionally done by venture capital firms a continuing lowyield environment drives wealth managers to partner with platforms the ecosystem develops new products and accesses established distribution channels including roboadvisors platforms invest in automation and ai to assist startups with preparing disclosures and make commercial due diligence available to investors at low cost platforms focus on the bb market and relegate the bc channel to prototyping new features platforms grow and improve liquidity allowing them to lead larger offerings platforms grow considerably especially for earlystage investments and even compete with venture capital firms in several markets especially where venture capital is weak critical conditions early signs a prolonged lowreturn environment leads wealth managers to look for other higheryield opportunities technology startups develop advanced analytics tools that help wealth managers perform due diligence early tentative partnerships between wealth managers and platforms are successful technology startups emerge that focus on improving the early stage due diligence process platforms demonstrate some early successes and build track records regulators accept partnerships with wealth managers introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion equity crowdfunding end state three crowdfunding plays an increasingly large role for seed stage funding but individual investors only interact with crowdfunding through their wealth managers shooting star implications for individual investors implications for incumbents implications for entrepreneurs investors gain the ability to allocate to highrisk highreturn crowdfunded equity engagement in the investment selection process decreases due to intermediation earlystage equity becomes a common source of diversification crowdfunding platforms gain scale through partnership with wealth managers due diligence technology leads to higher quality opportunities through better detection of bad eggs venture capital firms focus on laterstage opportunity because of increased competition at the seed stage both early and latestage startups have improved access to venture capitalliquidity barriers are lower when accessing platforms because due diligence is cheaper handled by platforms but more information is needed to pass due diligence introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion equity crowdfunding conclusion key takeaways for financial institutions improved liquidity at seed stage leading crowdfunding platforms will increase the amount of seedstage funding available to entrepreneurs thus filling a valuable niche in the fundraising ecosystem especially in parts of the world with less venture capital investment regulator balance regulation plays a significant role in shaping the equity crowdfunding industry across all possible end states whether crowdfunding platforms go direct to consumers or partner with incumbents regulators must balance encouraging crowdfunding and ensuring adequate due diligence integration with broader financial ecosystem in order to achieve a sustainable level of scale equity crowdfunding platforms will need to grow their scope of funding through integration with the broader financial ecosystem eg incorporation into wealth management platforms and will need to establish secondary markets with sufficient liquidity note

conclusion section market infrastructure world economic forum market infrastructure introduction market infrastructure has greatly evolved in the last several years this section examines the key trends shaping the industry and the uncertain path forward the first half of this decade saw the beginning of rapid change in the infrastructure underlying capital markets with the global entry of several innovative forces that had the potential to change how transactions were conducted circa the major forces impacting market infrastructure were capital requirements new platforms market regulations basel iii capital requirements challenged the engagement models of traditional sellside firms technologically enabled platforms were starting to appear in traditional overthecounterdriven markets led by europe many regions implemented additional controls around the exchange of assets circa the big uncertainties about the future of market infrastructure were how would electronic platforms develop and what assets would be electronified continued regulation have on the development of what effect would new trading tools how would incumbents seek to respond to new technologies used by startups note in this chapter a platform is an electronic environment that facilitates trading of financial products by offering one or more services along the continuum from price discovery to posttrade settlement introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion market infrastructure overview of findings the role of platforms in capital markets is growing if unevenly but regulatory changes and new technology will influence their adoption and capabilities where disruption occurred a b c traditional overthecounter otc products continue their journey towards electronification driven by regulation and the promise of improved economies of scale the efforts of electronic platforms to scale up are complicated by an uncertain and regionally fragmented regulatory environment and political instability market infrastructure providers are disrupting themselves to preserve a pivotal role in future processes and unlock new revenue streams where disruption did not occur d new market platforms have rarely challenged incumbents and instead see joint ventures and partnerships as the most successful path to scaling up introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion market infrastructure finding a traditional otc products continue their journey towards electronification driven by regulation and the promise of improved economies of scale the electronification of traditional otc asset classes eg fixed income has continued in recent years following the path of equity markets however this process has been uneven with some product types moving away from otc faster than others supporting evidence data and standardization platforms are collecting demandsupply data to create an aggregated market view and aid discovery of suitable counterparties and are even providing additional market analytics to better inform buyers sellers and intermediaries however securing data standards and crossplatform interoperability remains key to avoid fragmentation and secure liquidity during the electrification process regulatory push some postfinancial crisis regulations have required particular asset classes to move their trade and post trade processes to trading platforms eg interest rate swaps other regulations have provided indirect nudges towards trading platforms such as the european unions second markets in financial instruments directive mifid ii increasing the cost of traditional otc trading under the bestexecution imperative asset class characteristics certain asset classes have characteristics that naturally make them better suited for trading platforms products that are relatively homogenous and have low trade sizes are particularly good fits for trading platforms and have migrated quickly asset classes that lack those characteristics have struggled to reach a critical mass of supply and demand on the marketplace level introduction findings a b c d uncertainties end states conclusion market

derivatives from its existing allq platform to the bloomberg trading facility which launched in and is the companys first regulated european venue the allq platform accounted for of european government bond trades in late key uncertainties electronification of various asset classes the level and growth of electronification across asset classes varies considerably while the move to electronic platforms has been uneven it will likely continue in the push for transparency and liquidity how can stronger crossplatform cooperation be achieved to further improve access tools and standardize market language will regulators further expand the scope of asset classes which need to be traded via electronic trading platforms can buyside firms adjust to the requirements of direct platform access disintermediating the sell side sources financial times financial news bis introduction findings a b c d uncertainties end states conclusion market infrastructure finding b the efforts of electronic platforms to scale up are complicated by an uncertain and regionally fragmented regulatory environment and political instability postfinancial crisis regulation has generally upheld the themes of crossborder equivalence transparency and capital efficiency all of which support the electronification of trading however recent events are calling this trend into question supporting evidence postcrisis regulation platforms have been able to achieve scale quickly in the last few years by taking advantage of regulatory reforms such as mifid or doddfrank in the united states that were enacted in response to the financial crisis as the crisis becomes a relic of the past regulatory bodies around the world are starting to revisit financial crisisera policies political instability the widespread political uncertainty that enveloped many developed markets post has introduced new risks to capital markets slowing investments as financial institutions wait for clear signals on the priorities of newly formed governments regionalization the global regulatory trend over the last few decades has been one of increasing global interconnectivity and standardization which benefitted platforms journeys to scale however due to geopolitical factors and the regionalization of financial ecosystems the trend for the future is likely to be regionalization of regulatory policies

that a mix of fintech technological innovation and incumbent scale is the winning bet supporting evidence monoline challenges trading platforms with a narrow asset class or value chain focus ie most startups are struggling to meet the needs of incumbents who operate in many differentiated markets and thus look for efficiency and crossproduct synergies from their platforms incumbent adaptation incumbent banks brokers and platform providers can use available resources both talent and financial and the industrys high switching costs to their advantage rather than adopt fintech solutions they can either develop their own or acquire promising startups to bridge the gap stickiness even when significant efficiencies exist on new trading platforms two factors have created a strong stickiness for traditional trading methods the desire of incumbents to limit the integration of new technology platforms due to switching costs and a reluctance to disturb the complex network of individual and institutional relationships characterizing capital markets ongoing need for improvement incumbents who provide market access to investors remain slow at improving customerfriendly and cost efficient technologydriven relationship models due to inertia and a lack of expertise therefore fintechs represent an ideal partner for enriching and improving core technology as well as continuously improving

end states end states conclusion conclusion market infrastructure key uncertainties uncertainties around market infrastructure largely concern the future direction of regulation and the impact of new technologies on the industry what we know the four market infrastructure findings illustrate the increasing role of platforms in capital markets traditional otc products are becoming more and more electronified but are hindered in their efforts to scale up due to fragmented regulatory and technological environments in order to scale up and garner success joint ventures and partnerships between fintechs and incumbents are key through these findings the following key uncertainties around the future of market infrastructure emerged uncertainties what will political disruption and potential deregulation mean for platform trading and proliferation how will buyside investor demand for innovation and new business models shape the platform universe how far away are disruptive technologies such as ai and dlt from applicability and scalability in a production environment what will drive the necessary cooperation to embed new business models into the existing ecosystem how will disruptive technologies affect the value chain and individual roles in market infrastructure possible futures the resolution of these five key uncertainties paints three diverging pictures of the future of the market infrastructure industry platform proliferation datainfrastructure collision new posttrade value chains introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion market infrastructure potential end states depending on how the key uncertainties are resolved the potential end states have very different evolutionary paths and implications for all firms platform success datainfrastructure collision new posttrade value chains the first end state paints a world where market platforms enhance their tools and standardize languages trading in many asset classes becomes easier market participants adopt platforms en masse platforms continue to innovate as usage rises thus consolidating their market position the second end state paints a world where datafocused firms expand within the platform area infrastructure providers leverage information custody to provide data services as a result those players find themselves on a collision course users increasingly have fewer providers for both data and infrastructure the third end state paints a world where infrastructure providers disrupt the capital markets value chain improvements eg realtime settlement lead to new market structures some entities leave the ecosystem while others redefine their role additional resources are freed up by improvements to processes introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion market infrastructure end state one new platform capabilities including pre and posttrade processes will accelerate their adoption across asset classes market platforms enhance their tools and standardize languages to provide more intuitive trading workflows streamline pre and post trade processes and improve interoperability at the same time technological advancements make connecting buyside firms easier and improves matching of products to customers making sellside firms less relevant as a result platforms become cheaper and more convenient to trade on heightening their attractiveness for participants the move to platform adoption accelerates with some surprising asset classes successfully moving onto platforms critical conditions early signs a stable regulatory environment is favourable for market providers buyside clients adopt and use platforms on a significantly larger scale buyside firms start to partner directly with platform providers increasingly more platforms create significant liquidity in production as volumes of transactions executed via platforms grow further and for more asset classes introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion market infrastructure end state one the rise of additional platforms to facilitate trading increases pressure on incumbents to continue to improve benefiting the buy side implications for incumbent infrastructure providers more platform usage means incumbents must further develop their existing platform solutions to protect market share alternatively they could partner with emerging platforms or acquire them implications for regulators regulators would increase their visibility into the market as platform usage grows allowing for greater tracing of activities platform success implications for new entrants higher platform usage would direct traffic to innovative new entrants allowing them to gain market share more platform usage would also contribute to platform interoperability and multilateral relationships benefitting new entrants implications for buyside customers platforms would allow customers to become less dependent on sellside participants in the longer term introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion market infrastructure end state two as infrastructure and data providers encroach on the others core businesses customers will likely have to choose between them traditional providers of data platforms eg bloomberg continue their expansion into execution and posttrade processing deploying platforms for new asset classes meanwhile as margins in their core businesses erode traditional market infrastructure providers deepen their focus on monetizing their data flows with data platforms and market infrastructure providers on a collision course new points of competition will appear between them the competition creates both incentives and pressures for customers to reduce the number of partners as their data provider would likely operate the platforms they use critical conditions early signs the trend towards electronification of asset trading continues and even increases in pace platform infrastructure providers start focusing on hiring employees with a data background the platform environment remains highly competitive and pure access to standard products represents a commoditized service data andor platform providers start offering customers incentives to use their company for trading and data new technologies can be applied in enhanced data science eg ai and are coupled with robust monetization strategies introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion market infrastructure end state two customers may have additional choice regarding partnerships leading to lower costs and will likely work with fewer partners implications for incumbent infrastructure providers expansion may mean more partnerships with or acquisitions of dataheavy fintechs to acquire competencies regulatory questions may mean more partnerships to ensure easier risk management implications for regulators additional data means more opportunities to monitor the market however regulators will have to build connections with data providers an entirely new set of constituents datainfrastructure collision implications for incumbent data providers moving into the infrastructure field may mean new infrastructures with data at their core additional competition may mean more partnerships with or acquisitions of platform fintechs to gain competencies implications for buyside customers additional service providers may mean lower prices and additional benefits but one provider for both infrastructure and data however the rise of data means some level of acceptance is needed that their data is no longer solely theirs to use introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion market infrastructure end state three as incumbents invest in market infrastructure improvements the value chain will naturally shift leading to consolidation and role changes incumbent market infrastructure leaders start to invest in new infrastructure throughout posttrade processes eg shift to realtime settlement these improvements such as realtime settlement allow infrastructure providers to disrupt traditional capital market value chains by offering more services and taking on larger roles as a result intermediaries focusing on only one service get pushed out and posttrade facilities such as central securities depositories move from settlement towards oversight and trusted guarantor additionally improvements to the posttrade structure frees up additional resources for capital market incumbents as less capital has to be held for risk management critical conditions early signs significant investment in new technology by market infrastructure providers moves markets towards realtime and flexible settlement regulators accept new technologybased business models or even ecosystems embed them into existing regulatory frameworks and define the nature of the relationship to existing ecosystems new ecosystems are complementary on an international scale to reflect the global nature of capital markets investment share in new infrastructure technologies rises constantly over the next five years cooperative models on dlt ecosystems embrace growing numbers of industry stakeholders the first distributed ledger system is launched in production by a bank or an exchange organization and linked to posttrade activity introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion market infrastructure end state three these improvements to the value chain will lead to significant savings for buy side investors as cash flow management and risk management costs decline implications for incumbent infrastructure providers new technologies allow incumbent providers to revamp existing business models playing a bigger role in the value chain the need to offer more services as they play a bigger role in the value chain may mean consolidation to acquire expertise ongoing consolidation is likely to result in an increasing number of utilities and consortia aimed at cost mutualization for nondifferentiating and commoditized activities eg kyc or risk compliance implications for regulators improvements such as realtime settlement may mean a more difficult role for regulators as there is less time for review new posttrade value chains implications for fintechs the changes to infrastructure mean that blockchainrelated or other realtime focused firms will find many partners however incumbents ability to own more of the value chain may make it harder for fintechs to gain market share implications for buyside customers improvements to posttrade settlement will allow for simple cash flow management and streamlined operations increasing profits in the long run introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion market infrastructure conclusion key takeaways for financial institutions insufficiency of technology alone new technological solutions alone are insufficient to enable the creation of new market infrastructure or to drive significant changes in existing infrastructure this will make minimum viable ecosystems of cooperating stakeholders critical to development leading players from both the public and private sphere will seek to actively participate in and shape the direction of these stakeholder groups navigating regulatory uncertainty differing regulatory direction around the world will likely lead to both regionalization and uncertainty in the short and medium term financial institutions will need to develop the flexibility to rapidly adapt to both largescale regulatory changes and regionally divergent regulatory treatment of emergingmarket infrastructure technologies new value chain pressures and opportunities regulation and technological advancements are driving efficiencies which will put pressure on incumbents to consolidate their positions and thus shorten the value chain forwardlooking firms will seek to position themselves in areas that will continue to add value including areas currently

identity project is the most recent phase of the forums ongoing disruptive innovation in financial services work the future of financial services the future of financial services project explored the landscape of disruptive innovations in financial services provided the first consolidated taxonomy for these disruptions and explored their potential impacts on the structure of the industry beyond the future of financial services this phase of the disruptive innovation work explores two topics with key potential as foundational enablers of future disruption a blueprint for digital identity the role of financial institutions in building digital identity this project explores the potential for digital identity in financial services and beyond and lays out a blueprint for the implementation of effective digital identity systems the future of financial infrastructure an ambitious look at how blockchain can reshape financial services this project explores the potential for distributed ledger technology to transform the infrastructure of the financial services industry the mandate of this project was to explore digital identity and understand the role that financial institutions should play in building a global standard for digital identity project context identity is a critical topic in financial services today current identity systems are limiting fintech innovation and well as secure and efficient service delivery in financial services and society more broadly digital identity is widely recognized as the next step in identity systems however while many efforts are underway to solve parts of the identity challenge and create true digital identity there is a need for a concerted and coordinated effort to build a truly transformational digital identity system this document is intended as a guide for chief strategy officers of financial institutions as well as policy makers who are interested in the topic of identity and want to understand the digital identity and their own potential role in the creation of robust digital identity systems project scope the mandate of this project was to explore identity and its importance in fintech financial services and in developed societies broadly the topic of digital identity and provide a landscape scan of current efforts to build digital identity solutions this report will discuss different structures for identity systems and discuss which configurations are best suited to solve different problems and provide a perspective on the role of financial institutions in building digital identity systems this report will not focus on the creation of standards around identity much valuable work has already been done in this space and current developments such as the publication of the european union eidas regulation are moving the conversation on this front nor will it discuss technology solutions rather it will attempt to provide clarity and direction around the structure of identity and provide a call to action for financial institutions to move against the identity challenge world economic forum over months of research we engaged with subject matter experts through interviews and multistakeholder workshops industry leaders guidance and thought leadership from csuite executives and strategy officers of global financial institutions subject matter experts inperson and phone interviews with subject matter and industry experts global workshops four multistakeholder workshops at global financial hubs with total participants including industry leaders innovators subject matter experts and regulators singapore oct new york usa nov london uk dec davos switzerland jan world economic forum this report synthesizes our findings and presents a point of view on the role that we see for financial institutions in digital identity project outcomes our perspective the role of financial institutions in digital identity how should financial institutions engage with digital identity what role can they play in the development of digital identity solutions introduction what is the global identity challenge and what problems does it pose for financial institutions digital identity primer what is the purpose of identity systems and why is digital identity the solution to the global identity challenge the landscape of digital identity what do efforts to build digital identity systems look like globally the right solution to the right problem how should digital identity systems be constructed to serve different needs benefits of digital identity who stands to benefit from the introduction of digital identity systems implementation how do you reach a global digital identity solution world economic forum the role of financial institutions in digital identity current identity systems place major limitations on fintech innovation lack of digital identity limits the development and delivery of efficient secure digitalbased fintech offerings identity is currently a critical pain point for fintech innovators many of these innovators are trying to deliver pure digital offerings but the process of identifying users consistently forces them to use physical channels these fintech innovators now see the development of a new generation of digital identity systems as being crucial to continuing innovation and delivering efficient secure digitalbased fintech offerings examples payments payments require validation of ach information meaning that digital payments innovators must either require users to provide identity information through pseudodigital channels such as by photographing their drivers license or act as platforms on top of established financial institutions and rely on their kyc processes loans evaluating customer risk and issuing loans requires validation of basic customer information requiring innovators to gather information from users again through pseudodigital channels such as photographing existing id or gathering trusted information from an existing source and therefore decentralizing a central piece of the product offering world economic forum digital identity is a critical enabler of activity inside financial services broadly digital identity would allow fis to perform critical activities with increased accuracy over that afforded by physical identity and to streamline and partially or fully automate many processes identity is also central to the broader financial services industry enabling delivery of basic financial products ands services reliance on physical identity protocols introduces inefficiency and error to these processes digital identity has great potential to improve core financial services processes and open up new opportunities examples operational decisions traditional fs offerings such as insurance and credit and well as customer experience such as contact centers and collections rely on accurate and detailed knowledge of the customer regulatory compliance fis are required to comply with strict regulation on identifying their customers and are liable for mistakes and inaccuracies customer experience and product delivery improved knowledge of customer preferences and habits can help fis deliver radically better customer experience eg tailor authentication requirements based on behaviour world economic forum the relevance of digital identity stretches beyond financial services to society as a whole identity enables many societal transactions making strong identity systems critical to the function of society as a whole physical identity systems currently put users at risk due to overexposure of information and the high risk of information loss or theft they also put society at risk due to the potential for identity theft allowing illicit actors to access public and private services digital identity would streamline and rerisk completion of these public and private transactions public transactions private transactions entities are required to prove their identities or certain attributes to demonstrate their eligibility for public services examples access to social assistance eg old age security unemployment insurance access to education access to healthcare access to civic structures eg voting entities are often required to prove their identities or certain attributes to participate in private transactions examples many basic merchant transactions eg buying alcohol large private provider transactions eg renting an apartment buying a car world economic forum the need for digital identity is becoming increasingly pressing five key trends are increasingly the need for efficient and effective identity systems increasing transaction volumes the number of identitydependent transactions is growing through increased use of the digital channel and increasing connectivity between entities increasing transaction complexity transactions increasingly involve very disparate entities without previously established relationships eg customers and businesses transacting crossborder rising customer expectations customers expect seamless omnichannel service delivery and will migrate to services that offer the best customer experience more stringent regulatory requirements regulators are demanding increased transparency around transactions meaning that fis require greater granularity and accuracy in the identity information that they capture and are increasingly being held liable for inaccurate or missing identity information increasing speed of financial reputational damage bad actors in financial systems are increasing sophisticated in the technology and tools that they use to conduct illicit activity increasing their ability to quickly cause financial and reputational damage by exploiting weak identity systems world economic forum however identity is a multilayered problem making the creation of digital identity systems complex each layer of identity of serves a different purpose and suffers from a distinct set of problems in todays identity landscape goals providing efficient effective and seamless services to users provisioning what services users are entitled to access based on their attributes providing mechanisms for exchanging attributes between parties providing mechanisms for linking users to attributes capturing and storing user attributes developing standards to govern system operation service delivery authorization problems inefficient or unsuited service delivery complex authorization rules and relationships attribute exchange insecure and privacy compromising attribute exchange authentication weak or inconvenient authentication attribute collection standards inaccurate or insufficient attribute collection lack of coordination and consistency there are currently many distinct gaps in the digital identity landscape confusing authentication with identity many efforts today focus on authentication as a solution to the identity challenge without addressing the strength of the underlying attribute collection and authorization processes authentication technology solutions while valuable rely on preexisting onboarding and attribute collection processes authentication solutions provided by global technology platforms are convenient for users but do not provide security or verification of the identity behind an account or username enabling transaction completion rather than user activity many solutions are driven by the goals and perspectives of a single organization and therefore are designed to serve the needs of particular transactions rather the broader needs of users egovernment solutions are intended to make government service delivery to users more efficient and do not enable further transactions in which users might want to participate transactionfocussed solutions result in the repeated collection of tombstone data rather than effective collection of usercentric and riskrelevant data such as transaction habits building consensus rather than driving action many efforts focus on building agreement around standards and processes rather than creating a full identity solution and therefore do not result in private sectorimplementable solutions utilities and standards organizations are focussed on creating consensus and a standardized view of data rather than providing a full identity solution multigovernmental efforts have considerable scale but are mainly focussed at the regulatory level and do not offer a commercially viable solutions world economic forum these gaps are a result of the crowded digital identity landscape with many different entities building solutions technology solution providers technology solution providers focus on point solutions for authentication attribute exchange or identity management for enterprises private service providers private service providers focus on collecting the attributes they themselves need to provide specific services to users global technology companies global technology companies act as platforms to authenticate users to a wide variety of other service providers service delivery authorization attribute exchange authentication attribute collection standard development service delivery authorization attribute exchange authentication attribute collection standard development service delivery authorization attribute exchange authentication attribute collection standard development industry bodies industry bodies focus on standardizing and centralizing the collection of attributes within that specific industry governments governments focus on the provision of identity to their citizens and providing citizens with services based on these attributes standards organizations standards organizations focus on frameworks and guidance for developing identity systems service delivery authorization attribute exchange authentication attribute collection standard development service delivery authorization attribute exchange authentication attribute collection standard development service delivery authorization attribute exchange authentication attribute collection standard development world economic forum there is an opening for new digital identity systems that can deliver scope and scale while many ongoing efforts such as new authentication solutions are critical to building digital identity there is a core need for a strong system will enable effective action against each layer of the stack the entire stack does not need to be provided by a single entity some components may be modular but the entire stack must be effective and integrated to provide digital identity systems that have certain critical features service delivery authorization attribute exchange authentication attribute collection standards critical characteristics of a strong identity system operationally effective the system allows digital transactions to be completed conveniently and effectively scope scale the system enables large volumes of transactions through provision of transactioncritical attributes and connecting large numbers of users with important and frequently used service providers security the system prevents user information from being overexposed lost or stolen user control privacy the system allows users to determine where their information is held and when it is shared or exposed viability the system delivers value to all stakeholders creating broad support and uptake and making it a commercially viable system world economic forum financial institutions are well positioned to drive the creation of digital identity systems financial institutions are exceptionally well positioned to drive identity systems that fill the gaps left by current efforts structural fis already act as stores of customer attributes for their own commercial purposes and therefore are positioned to act as identity providers without extensive incremental effort fis are one of very few types of institutions that can verify user information they already perform this function for commercial and regulatory purposes fis are incentivized to collect accurate user information for their own commercial purposes fis have proven executional ability to develop new systems and standards eg interac that have been widely adopted and effectively used within the private sector the fs industry has nearcomplete coverage of users people legal entities and assets in developed economies global fis have interconnected operations across multiple jurisdictions giving them a structural advantage in enabling cross jurisdictional identity transactions and systems positioning fi operations and use of customer data are rigorously regulated fis act as established intermediaries in many transactions and are therefore well positioned to act as identity intermediaries fis are typically trusted by consumers beyond other institutions to be safe repositories of information and assets world economic forum there is a strong business case for financial institutions to lead the development of digital identity systems fis could derive substantial benefit from investing in the development of digital identity solutions we have categorized these benefits into three categories efficiency cost avoidance new revenue opportunities brand enhancement and transformational future state opportunities efficiency cost avoidance new revenue opportunities transformational future state opportunities opportunities to streamline current processes increase automation and reduce error and human intervention opportunities to create new revenue streams from new products and services and to increase the positive recognition of the brand opportunities to stretch outside of core business and capabilities to create transformational new business models and reach new customers world economic forum financial institutions could benefit from basic efficiency improvements and cost avoidance efficiency cost avoidance process streamlining automation streamline and improve onboarding and compliance processes through access to a reliable and consolidated digital view of user attributes minimizing rfis and information remediation due to inaccuracy and human error improved service delivery provide increasingly tailored products and services to customers by leveraging nontraditional attributes improve process efficiency and increase stp by automating processes through use of standardized reliable digital data improved customer experience improve customer experience by leveraging a variety of user attributes to better understanding the customers needs and preferences improved risk assessment scoring improve risk assessment and reduce fraud by creating more holistic and accurate customer risk profiles to inform suspicious transaction monitoring insurance payouts and provision of credit and riskbased products world economic forum develop new revenue streams new revenue opportunities new financial products services offer new products and services based on increased knowledge of customers eg extended financial advisory new insurance products such as insurance on fractionally owned assets and behaviourbased insurance identityasaservice offer identity as a service to relying parties who cannot or do not wish to store customer information identityonly customers offer identity as a separate feebased service for individuals who do not otherwise transact with that fi world economic forum and stretch beyond current business and markets to fundamentally transform their businesses transformational future state opportunities allocation of liability shift the liability for incorrect information and the outcomes of holding this information from financial institutions to other entities in the network eg users through approval and consent requirements trust brokerage act as a broker of trust in previously trustless interactions between disparate parties in multiple industries expanding the reach of fis beyond the fs industry and reaching new profit pools disruption of the credit bureau model evaluate customer creditworthiness based on accurate identity data including preferences and financial history rather than relying on third parties and the mining of multiple different data sources refocussing around the customer refocus business around customer service assisting with daytoday decisioning and blurring the lines between financial and nonfinancial advisory public sector partnerships become the trusted identity provider of the public sector assisting with social services and civic requirements such as tax filing world economic forum we are calling on fis to champion the development of digital identity systems fis should champion efforts to build digital identity systems driving the building and implementation of identity platforms through the creation of minimum viable digital identity systems requirements of a minimum viable identity system identity provision identity providers that hold trusted information and have coverage over a critical mass of users within their target area and can therefore serve a large number of users and transactions hightransaction volume attributes secure storage of verified attributes that are required for common transactions inherent attributes such as name date of birth nationality national identifier number and some assigned attributes such as address relying party adoption involvement of relying parties that offer important and frequently used userfacing services technology platform a technology platform that enables secure attribute exchange between identity providers and relying parties with a convenient user consent mechanism eg operates on mobile and desktop system standards supervisory liability standards that guide operation and use of user information in the system and provide liability and user recourse legal regulatory acceptance legal regulatory acceptance for using thirdparty verified information attribute exchange and external use of user information world economic forum fis could take several different approaches to creating identity systems there are different configuration options for the development of digital identity systems each with advantages and drawbacks singleinstitution consortium utility global institutions could create internal systems that stretch across the jurisdictions in which they operate this would enable quick implementation but a single institution would likely have difficulty in gaining a critical mass of users limiting its ability to drive system adoption and integration of relying parties consortiums of financial institutions could form networks that cover large contained oligopoly economies such as canada or australia a consortium requires a high degree of collaboration among parties but is an effective method of getting complete coverage over a user group consortiums are well suited to provide identity for individuals as data storage is not centralized increasing privacy and system resilience financial institutions could create industry utilities to deliver identity services across the industry this model is effective in creating standardization and broad coverage but implementation may be difficult due to the involvement of many different stakeholders utilities are a good model for legal entity and asset identity because they provide a standardized view and golden record of information world economic forum this report will provide guidance on constructing effective and robust digital identity systems while avoiding implementation pitfalls implementation of identity systems is extremely sensitive and therefore easy to get wrong situational operational and cultural factors all have important implications for identity systems and implementation or operational failure has extremely negative consequences for both the drivers of identity system eg wasted resources and for users eg data breaches we have studied the landscape of identity providers to understand what efforts are ongoing and which system models are best suited to different situations and to provide recommendations on system configuration and implementation implementation interconnection call to action highlights the next steps and key stakeholders that must be involved to successfully implement a digital identity network benefits of digital identity introduces the stakeholders that are involved in a digital identity network and the types of benefits each stakeholder may derive blueprint for digital identity introduction introduces the global identity challenge and how problems with identity manifest for financial institutions digital identity primer summarizes key digital identity concepts the landscape of digital identity systems describes the landscape of digital identity solutions and introduces a set of archetypes that represent the existing set of solutions the right solution to the right problem discusses how identity solutions should be configured for success world economic forum the global identity challenge identity is critical to todays society identity is foundational to many of the transactions that occur in todays society in any exchange with requirements about the transacting parties they must be a certain age or reside in a certain jurisdiction structures must be in place that allow entities to determine certain information about their counterparty and to have confidence that the information is true how do i know this entity is what it claims to be how do we know this person is who they claim to be what do they need to know about me can we transact with this person how do i know they wont misuse my information how can we deliver the right services to this person the role of identity in transactions many transactions do not require identity some such a crime reporting may in fact require anonymity however many transactions do require identity to determine if the necessary conditions for the transaction to occur exist to establish a relationship for repeated transactions or to tailor delivery of products and services society requires identity systems to enable identityrequiring transactions at scale putting methods in place that enable the formal asking and answering of identity queries at scale to allow many daytoday transactions to occur world economic forum ineffective identity systems create global challenges for people for businesses and for society as a whole reliance on legacy identity systems that do not effectively enable the transactions that people and entities wish to engage in create challenges for a wide set of stakeholders for people for businesses for society inefficient service delivery userfacing processes are cumbersome resulting in poor customer experience service exclusion entities may be unable to prove attributes and therefore be excluded from key social structures service exclusion individuals are excluded from key services due to their inability to demonstrate identity poor user experience services provided to users do not match their needs or are delivered inconveniently information overexposure user information is overexposed putting users at risk of identity theft and privacy breach lack of reliable information prevents businesses from accurately calculating the risk of doing obscure risk business fraud businesses suffer fraud resulting from stolen or incorrect customer information or poor authentication services are delivered incorrectly due to the lack service mismatch of information fraud entities can use false information or misrepresent information to gain illicit access to services process inefficiency processes are highly manual and paperbased requiring human intervention and remediation proving identity involves many steps and processes provide outofdate data or require process inefficiency checking multiple sources process inefficiency documents world economic forum these global identity challenges manifest as specific business problems for fis identity is critical to fis their businesses are entirely transactionbased involving transactions with a high degree of risk and require a high degree of certainty in completion global problems with identity therefore manifest as specific business problems for fis illustrative business problems in financial services business problem retail small to medium sized enterprise banking corporate and investment banking inefficient and costly onboarding processes inefficient costly and ineffective knowyourcustomer kyc and due diligence processes highly manual and timeconsuming compliance processes difficulty aggregating information on legal entities and determining total risk exposure difficulty attaching individual identity eg corporate directors to corporate identities difficulty identifying all transaction counterparties eg third parties in trading relationships difficulty complying with regulatory standards around data handling and privacy multiple views of the customer difficulty providing effectivesuitable products and services lack of visibility into financial history for new customers high fraud rates difficulty tracking asset origination and ownership difficulty monitoring and tracking asset rehypothecation world economic forum many of these challenges are driven by the use of physical identity protocols to serve digital transactions todays standard identity systems are based on physical documents and processes which creates many limitations characteristics of physical identity systems documentbased identity is based on physical records the ability to prove identity depends on access and authentication to physical documents eg passports id cards and records siloed identity information is held in discrete places that are not interconnected and do not enable aggregation which may be desired by the entity itself or required for some applications inflexible identity is codified in documents as a limited and standardized set of information about an entity that cannot be easily adapted to transaction requirements the problems with physical identity proof of identity that is based on possession of physical documents may not require demonstration of a link between an individual and the documents ie authentication enabling use of an entitys credentials by a different user physical identity documents can be falsified altered or tampered with as well as lost or stolen physical attribute presentation and transfer create the potential for human error in transactions the identity shift identity is now at an inflection point physical identity systems are breaking down and digital systems are emerging in response physical identity digital identity physical identity was designed to enable facetoface transactions among entities the digital economy is changing the way that identity transactions occur digital identity enables transactions in the digital world and offers improved functionality for its users world economic forum digital identity systems support the needs of todays world digital identity systems emerged as a direct response to the requirements of transactions in the digital world characteristics of digital identity systems digitalbased identity exists as a set of digital records that the user can control and use to complete transactions interconnected proof of identity can be communicated between entities in a standardized digital format flexible identity systems adapt to the nature of the transaction and continuously adapt to requirements by integrating additional information to create a rich view of the user the promise of digital identity digital information can be protected from damage tampering loss and theft with cuttingedge authentication and security protocols digital information can be shared in streamlined tailored and secure ways predicated on user consent institutions can better know and serve their customers improving existing products and offering new products and services to the underserved benefits digital identity would deliver a range of benefits to people businesses and society privacy and control people would be able to control access to their information revenue growth financial institutions would have opportunities to offer identityas aservice improved compliance regulators would have increased access to trusted uptodate information improved service delivery governments could more easily and effectively deliver public services world economic forum new and maturing technologies have important implications for the creation of robust digital identity systems these technologies may hold considerable promise for identity and are being explored by many different players data storage new technologies may offer improved methods of storing user information and increasing user control privacy and security distributed ledger technology combined with encryption and cloud storage allows information to be held and transferred pointtopoint in a dispersed immutable network federated identity standards such as saml create interoperability between identity management networks and external applications allowing federated identity systems to scale to large numbers of identity providers and relying parties data transfer improved attribute exchange protocols allow information to be securely shared between endpoints without risk of interception or decryption and with more controls that create privacy for users improved encryption protocols such as keyless signature infrastructure on the blockchain and hashing provide strong protection for sensitive information and increase the reliability of digital activities data transfer protocols such as attributed based credentials trust and zeroknowledge proofs prevent the creation of metadata by concealing transaction endpoints increasing user privacy authentication many new techniques for authenticating users are being explored for their potential to increase information security and user control in certain circumstances by linking users to their digital activities in more robust and persistent ways behavioural and contextual authentication incorporate human and environmental factors to authenticate a user or device biometrics including fingerprint retina scanning heartbeat waveform and facial recognition based on mobile devices have potential to provide greater convenience and security and are being integrated into many antifraud controls world economic forum digital identity systems have great potential but also many pitfalls in implementation many new identity systems are under development around the world in response to the need for digital identity and new technology capabilities however not all have been successful illustrating some of the pitfalls inherent in the construction of identity systems pitfalls in identity systems stakeholder rejection users may not adopt the system due to poor design or distrust of the systems purpose or structure stakeholders may perceive systems with limited scope and scale as valueless and therefore not adopt them ineffective technology a poor technology platform can reduce system functionality preventing user integration or transaction completion insufficient data protection results in breaches system compromise and data leakage limited support systems that have support from a narrow set of interests may fail due to inconsistent efforts behind their construction and operation systems that lack support from all key stakeholders may not experience sustainable and continuous uptake unsustainable operation systems with unsustainable operating or business models will fail policy changes large complex and emotive programmes such as id cards can be susceptible to political and or ideological shifts world economic

how to fight tax identity theft huffington post february fca fines barclays million for poor handling of financial crime risks automated trader november world economic forum identity is a collection of pieces of information that describe an entity identity is not a monolith it is a collection of individual attributes that describe an entity and determine the transactions in which that entity can participate while the total existing set of attributes is endless they can be broadly categorized into three groups inherent inherited and assigned attributes these attributes differ for members of three main user groups individuals legal entities and assets for individuals for legal entities for assets inherent attributes attributes that are intrinsic to an entity and are not defined by relationships to external entities age height date of birth fingerprints industry business status nature of the asset asset issuer accumulated attributes attributes that are gathered or developed over time these attributes may change multiple times or evolve throughout an entitys lifespan health records preferences and behaviours eg telephone metadata assigned attributes attributes that are attached to the entity but are not related to its intrinsic nature these attributes can change and generally are reflective of relationships that the entity holds with other bodies world economic forum national identifier number telephone number email address business record legal record ownership history transaction history identifying numbers legal jurisdiction directors identifying numbers custodianship specific attributes enable entities to complete certain transactions identity is the total set of an entitys attributes these attributes enable entities to participate in transactions by proving to their counterparty that they have the specific attributes required for that transaction example users and transactions individuals legal entities assets to purchase alcohol users must prove that they are over the legal drinking age in that jurisdiction to onboard with a fi the entity must have proof that it is a legal and non sanctioned entity asset trading such as trading of equities on a stock exchange requires proof of ownership and origination to vote users must prove that they are over the legal voting age have citizenship and reside in that jurisdiction to transact in capital markets the entity must have proof that it is a legal and nonsanctioned entity with an acceptable risk profile transfer of title of an asset requires proof of ownership from the entity that is transferring the asset to open a bank account users must prove that they are a nonsanctioned person who is legally allowed to engage in financial transactions note assets have identity but are unable to act or transact on their own assets require custodians who are entitled to act or transact on the assets behalf world economic forum identity transactions have three main aspects authorization attributes authentication what must be true about the users to complete the desired transaction authorization is a function of the transaction and the transaction counterparty they will determine the requirements for transaction eligibility and make a query about certain user attributes eg age address repeated identity transactions can users prove that they are eligible to complete this transaction users must present their proof of attributes in response to the query once users present the required attributes the counterparty must determine if they are reliable do the attributes being presented genuinely belong to the entity that is presenting them the counterparty will determine whether the attributes match the presenting users if the users are able to authenticate the attributes the transaction can proceed this model of identity transaction applies to onboarding transactions that is transactions where the counterparties do not have an established relationship or where the counterparty is required to gather identity information with every transaction some identity relationships may have a single onboarding transaction after initially onboarding the users and verifying them through a full identity transaction the counterparty may use an authentication method eg username and password chipandpin card for each subsequent transaction this allows them to verify that the same entity is transacting each time without going through the full identity transaction process note not all transactions require exact knowledge of attributes many transactions simply require attribute data to fall inside certain parameters eg instead of knowing an individuals birthdate a transaction may only require that the user be over a certain age this is critical in constructing privacyenhancing identity systems world economic forum different identity transactions require different levels of assurance the level of assurance loa in an identity transaction is the degree of certainty that the transacting parties have in the veracity of the identity being presented assurance in transactions a high loa in identity transactions is not always desirable as a high loa requires intensive onboarding and strong authentication processes that may be cumbersome for the user the loa required in an identity transaction should therefore generally be dependent on risk the risk level of the transaction and the consequences of error determing assurance levels the level of assurance of a given transaction is determined by two main factors registration protocols how stringently the identity provider verifies attributes when onboarding users authentication method the strength of the authentication method used to complete transactions between the identity provider and the relying party low assurance transactions high assurance transactions transactions that do not involve a release of information and only involve an information flow from the user to the relying party are lowassurance transactions examples include online registrations eg signing up for a news site and some payments eg paying a parking ticket online transactions that involve the release of sensitive and private information or the transfer of money or assets are high assurance transactions examples include banking and other financial transactions such as using an online brokerage account and many government services world economic forum identity systems tend to evolve inside natural boundaries identity exists within networks that enable transactions between the entities inside that network these networks tend to evolve around user groups with similar needs and characteristics these boundaries form what are called natural identity networks every natural identity network has different needs and therefore will require different system configurations natural identity networks the networks that form inside the natural boundaries of identity systems for individuals are based on geographic location or affiliations with a supervisory entity the networks that form inside the natural boundaries of identity systems for legal entities are based on national affiliation industry or geographic reach examples include national identity systems state or provincial identity systems and employee management systems world economic forum examples include national or global business registries and industry identifier systems the networks that form inside the natural boundaries of identity systems for assets are based on their asset class origination or ownership examples include registries of assets of a single class or registries of assets that are all owned by a single entity and operate on a basic shared structure the purpose of a formal identity system is to allow counterparties without a previously established relationship to engage in trusted transactions in a formal identity system the users attributes are attested to by trusted third parties these third parties issue credentials that tie their attestation to the specific attributes with some method of authenticating the credential to the entity that is presenting it users can use their wallet of credentials to engage in transactions with other entities that require some proof or knowledge of their attributes the structure of identity systems the user presents a set of attributes to a third party lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum the third party verifies the attributes and attaches its attestation to the attributes becoming an identity provider for the user the user then uses the credential from the identity provider in transactions with relying parties lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum world economic forum certain roles and functions must exist in every identity system every identity system must have four roles and one function to operate users users are entities for which the system provides identity for the purpose of allowing them to engage in transactions identity providers identity providers idps are entities that hold user attributes attest to their veracity and complete identity transactions on behalf of users relying parties relying parties rps are entities that accept attestations from identity providers about user identity to allow users to access their services governance body governance body the governance body provides the governance body provides oversight for the system and owns oversight for the system and owns the operating standards and the operating standards and requirements requirements attribute exchange platform the attribute exchange platform completes transactions by matching identity queries from rps with attributes from idps and exchanging attributes or proof of identity world economic forum role function methods have evolved but the concept of identity proofing has not changed over time the fundamental concept purpose and structure of identity systems have not changed over time while methods and technology have made huge strides forward past present a letter of introduction is one of the oldest forms of identity documentation user individuals would use a letter of introduction as an attestation of identity and character to someone they did not know idp the letter writers would provide attestations for various attributes of the users eg that the user was a person of good character rp the recipients of the letter would choose whether or not to accept the attestations based on their knowledge of the idp and their evaluation of the letters veracity today a passport issued by an individuals country of residence or origin is one of the most common trusted identity documents user individuals are often asked to present their passport to complete transactions that require proof of identity eg entering new countries opening a bank account etc idp the government of that country acts as an idp making certain attestations about the user rp the attestations made by the idp are accepted by a rp based on its trust in the document its issuer and its evaluation of whether the bearer is the true owner of the passport world economic forum digital identity allows identity transactions to be completed through digital channels a digital identity system has the same basic structure as a physical identity system but attribute storage and exchange are entirely digital removing reliance on physical documents and manual processes features of digital identity systems digital information storage and transfer user identity information is captured and stored in digital form user identity information is transferred between idps and rps in digital form form factors such as computer or mobile devices rather than physical documents can be used to complete transactions direct connectivity information transfer occurs directly between idps and rps without an intermediary although user consent can be built in and without manual intervention eg physical information entry the current landscape of digital identity digital identity is not a new concept many identity systems exist in the world today that either incorporate some digital elements or are entirely digitalbased systems the landscape of digital identity solutions is explored further in the next section of this report these systems exist along a spectrum of maturity and degree of sophistication however all are designed to capture some of the benefits that digital identity brings over traditional physicalbased identity systems world economic forum digital identity offers significant benefits over physical identity systems beyond offering new functionality digital identity has significant functional benefits over physicalbased identity systems security physical identity documents can easily be lost stolen or replicated by illicit actors as well as read by entities with no legitimate reason to have the user information digital identity information could be stored transferred and exposed using cuttingedge digital security protocols that would prevent against data breach modification loss and theft privacy and control physical identity does not allow the release of information to be tailored to the identity transaction identity documents display a fixed set of information that can be read by almost any entity digital identity allows individuals to control the sharing of their information to expose the minimum amount of information required for a given transaction and shield their information from illicit access user experience physical identity requires users to manually show documents or enter identity information in transactions resulting in a cumbersome user experience and creating potential for human error in transactions digital information transfer would streamline the transaction process for users and rps across all channels increasing the ease of transacting for both parties and removing the potential for human error flexibility physical identity results in the crystallization of user identity in physical documents and a fixed view of identity that cannot digital identity would provide a flexible and scalable system that could incorporate a greater richness of identity be expanded to cover additional user attributes information than is currently possible world economic forum the landscape of digital identity systems many digital identity systems exist in the world today serving various natural networks the digital identity systems that exist today fall across broad ranges of purpose scope and sophistication some systems have a digital element bolted onto what is still fundamentally a physical identity system while others are fully digital and are built to scale and expand as user needs evolve disparate identity systems were studied including systems for all user groups to understand the landscape of digital identity solutions categorize these systems and draw highlevel conclusions on which systems best suit different needs types of digital identity systems systems for individuals the majority of identity systems are designed for individuals and are often governmentdriven systems purpose designed to increase financial or social inclusion and streamline the delivery of services or to control access to internal systems for a single organization systems for legal entities identity systems for legal entities often take the form of centralized registries of information that are owned by a single government or utility systems for assets identity systems for assets often take the form of a centralized registry or an internal system for a single organization purpose intended to standardize data across entities streamline processes and enable data aggregation at a macro level purpose intended to clarify ownership standardize data or enable the operation of networked systems world economic forum the most significant differences in identity systems fall across three primary dimensions primary dimensions of choice are the set of choices that must be made in the design of a digital identity system that have the greatest impact on the systems function and structure these are not always conscious choices they are often a natural outcome of the setting in which the system is being implemented and the problem that the system is intended to solve or the needs that it is intended to serve the three primary dimensions of choice are nature of identity provision is there a single source of identity information are there a limited set of parties who provide attributes is identity provision distributed across many different entities number of relying parties nature of information transfer is there a single rp that can access user attributes or are there many rps that can access user information is information transferred from the idp to the rp for the purpose of authenticating a user or is there a transfer of user attributes that the rp requires to execute a given transaction centralized one entity stores and provides the identity information federated a limited number of entities store and provide identity information distributed many different entities store and provide identity information one the system has a single rp that is able to access identity information many the system incorporates many rps that are able to access identity information authentication the idp authenticates the user for the rp allowing the rp to complete transactions using information or records that the rp holds transaction the rp requires information from the idp for the purposes of completing a transaction for the user world economic forum world economic forum we have defined five distinct archetypes that exhibit significant differences in structure and purpose internal identity management external authentication centralized identity federated authentication distributed identity e r u t c u r t s one entity acts as both the idp and rp many idps authenticate users to a single rp one idp serves many rps the system has a single idp that authenticates users and transfers or exposes attributes to many different rps the system provides users within a single network access to services that they are permissioned to access based on their attributes all user attributes are held inside the single entity and are used to permission users to either grant or deny access to a given service or pathway the system authenticates users to the rp based on their authentication to one of a set of idps no attributes are transferred between the idps and the rp the authentication transaction is used to simply grant or deny the user access to the services offered by the rp a set number of idps authenticate users to many rps the system has a single idp that stores user information while a separate set of idps authenticate users who are attempting to transact with rps after authentication the requested attributes are transferred from the idp that holds attributes to the rp with which the user is transacting many idps serve many different rps the system involves multiple idps that authenticate users and transfer attributes to many different rps n o i t a m r o f n i f o w o l f world economic forum identity provider idp relying party rp attribute flow authentication flow internal identity management solutions are designed for use by one entity internal identity management in internal identity management systems the same entity acts as an idp and a rp the entity uses information that it holds on users to permission them to access various internal services a good example of an internal identity management system would be a company or a government that permissions its employees or citizens to access different services based on their attributes key archetype features the idprp owns the required attributes needed to determine user permissions within the organization the system is used to control which users within a single organization or entity have permission to access certain services these types of solutions are generally developed by private organizations and sold as a product or service to various entities and institutions case studies closed internal management systems private solutions global leading software as a solution saas providers such as salesforce oracle sap and microsoft provide solutions that help their customers better understand manage and interact with a set of users saas has become a common delivery model for many business as these solutions help keep users data and applications within a closed system secure these solutions serve a variety of industries and user groups eg customers employees citizens etc world economic forum external authentication systems facilitate access to hightraffic services external authentication in external authentication systems one entity acts as both the idp and the rp but uses an additional external set of idps to authenticate its users the purpose of this system is to improve user experience for individuals or businesses when accessing online services these users can use existing logins rather than maintaining multiple usernames and passwords for each service key archetype features the system has one rp often a government that holds user information and leverages a set of established institutions as idps eg fis telecom providers the idps are usually trusted entities that perform strong authentication in user onboarding and are therefore trusted to provide a high level of assurance in identity transactions users can use their existing authentication methods through this group of idps to gain access to the rps services both the rp and idps store user attributes the authentication system is used to verify that the entity authenticating through the idp should be permitted to transact with the rp no attributes are transferred from idps to the rp case studies govuk verify publicprivate programme united kingdom the govuk verify programme is an external authentication system that allows uk citizens to access government services online users verify their identity online with one of nine idps once the users are authenticated through one of these providers they are granted access to the government service they are trying to access securekey concierge publicprivate solution canada securekey concierge is a digital authentication system that allows individuals to choose a trusted credential they already have with one of a set of fis to access government services online the users log in with their online banking username and password and are authenticated by their bank once authenticated the users are granted access to the service no attributes are transferred in the system world economic forum centralized identity systems use one idp as a single source of truth centralized identity in centralized identity systems a single entity acts as an idp that authenticates users to rps and transfers their attributes these systems are often designed to streamline service delivery enable data aggregation and provide a single view of users across multiple rps key archetype features a single idp holds all user attributes and owns the identity system this is often the government or another central governing body the idp authenticates the user to the rp and transfers either a fixed or a tailored set of attributes to the rp to enable it to complete a transaction on behalf of the user some systems require rps to pay a fee to use the system and to gain access to user attributes identity information can be transferred directly through a physical form factor eg a smart card or through a digital brokerage system case studies digid government programme netherlands digid is a digital authentication system for dutch residents who are accessing government services online individual attributes are held in a national citizen registry these attributes are used to authenticate users when they apply for a digid individuals can then use their digid username and password to authenticate themselves to government agencies their national identifier number is transferred from the national citizen registry to the rp population registry government programme finland the population registry is a national database that is owned and maintained by the finnish government the government acts as the idp transferring attributes to public and private rps the purpose of the system is to collect data that can be used for elections tax filing judicial administration etc private rps may also access this data if they pay a fee and have received user consent world economic forum federated authentication systems rely on third parties to grant user access to services federated authentication in federated authentication systems one idp uses a set of third parties to authenticate users to a range of rps the primary idp is the entity that stores and transfers user attributes these systems are designed to improve the login and transaction processes for users who are accessing online services by allowing them to use a single set of credentials to authenticate and transferring attributes to rps on their behalf key archetype features a set of thirdparty idps act as brokers that authenticate users to the rps identity information is stored centrally by one idp with which they are attempting to transact rps are able to access user attributes from the primary idp often for a fee many systems also require explicit user consent for attributes to be transferred in systems that allow for the discretionary transfer of attributes rather than a fixed set of attributes the user must explicitly consent to the transfer of specified attributes from the primary idp to the rp these systems are often governmentdriven and the government acts as the central idp that holds citizen or entity data case studies nemid private sector solution denmark nemid is an electronic id digital signature and secure email solution that provides individuals access to public and private services the government tendered the system to the private sector users use a common nemid login and password as well as unique onetime passwords to authenticate themselves to online services user attributes are stored in a central registry sweden bankid publicprivate service sweden sweden has established an eid system that provides citizens and businesses access to over public and private services digital identities are issued by a set of private entities including large banks and a major telecommunications provider the public sector buys identity validation services from the private sector private sector service providers can join the bankid system by signing contracts with eid providers for authentication the solution has been very successful over million citizens currently use the service world economic forum distributed identity systems connect many idps and rps distributed identity in distributed identity systems many idps collect store and transfer user attributes to many rps these systems are notable in that they do not rely on attributes from a single idp the purpose of these systems is to allow users to interact easily with many different entities in an online environment by giving them a digital wallet of credentials key archetype features identity information may be stored by multiple idps on a distributed protocol eg blockchain or may be collected from a variety of sources and aggregated by a single entity that operates the system attributes can be transferred from idps to rps through a variety of methods including smart cards or digitalmobile protocols these systems are often privately owned and funded governments or other public sector bodies may not play an active role within the network users own their own identities and often control which transactions occur and what attributes are transferred from one or more idps to the rp these systems may not have a governance body and instead rely on common operating standards for interoperability world economic forum case studies tupas private sector solution finland tupas is an identity system in which over banks act as idps individuals can log into a wide range of services with credentials from their bank the users full names and national id numbers are transferred from the idp to the rp global legal entity identifier foundation gleif nonprofit organization global gleif supports the implementation of the legal entity identifier lei standard this system assigns leis to every entity that engages with fis entities can use their counterpartys lei to access their identity information from the gleifs partner network mobile connect gsma global mobile connect is a digital identity system that authenticates the users through their device allowing users to access a variety of services this eliminates the need for users to have many usernames and passwords to access online services the potential of blockchain technology in identity blockchain or distributed ledger technology dlt is a technology protocol that allows data to be shared directly between entities in a network without intermediaries dlt has certain key features that hold potential for identity systems features of distributed ledger technology low transaction cost distributed ledgers eliminate the need for intermediaries and therefore lower the cost of completing transactions transaction history is maintained and verified through the network preventing the falsification of immutability information convenience recordkeeping and transactions can be executed from any device on or offline illustrative applications of dlt in digital identity dlt has potential in identity applications as an information storage and transfer mechanism within different archetypes dlt could be applied as a distributed protocol giving users the ability to store their identity attestations on a ledger and expose them to different rps or in a centralized system where the ledger would be owned by a single entity that would provide a consolidated view of the users attestations for use in transactions but would not reveal the nature of the credentials many initiatives are currently underway that explore the true potential for dlt in identity systems this report will not explore this topic in detail world economic forum the right solution for the right problem the archetypes of digital identity are built to serve very different needs internal identity management best suited to manage user permissions inside a single entity based on internal information to ensure the right individuals have access to the right resources and endpoints example large organizations that need an identity access and management solution to control access to their internal services with a select user group eg employees customers etc external authentication best suited to streamline user access to a suite of services that are offered by a single entity and eliminate proprietary logins example a government offering its citizens online services that are critical but infrequently used centralized identity best suited to provide a single version of the truth and a complete accurate and standardized view of nonconfidential data across different users example an industry utility offering a comprehensive view of the entities in that industry to manage risk and exposure federated authentication best suited to provide a single version of the truth and a complete accurate and standardized view of data while allowing users to authenticate to a set of third parties thereby eliminating proprietary logins example a government enabling identity transactions for its citizens through collaboration with third parties distributed identity best suited to incorporate large numbers of idps and rps providing user convenience control and privacy in an online environment example a full digital economy requiring multiple independent connections between idps and rps to enable user transactions world economic forum two of these archetypes are well suited to solve broad identity problems centralized and distributed identity systems are best suited to provide digital identity at scale however these two archetypes are not equally well suited to provide identity for different user groups for individuals for legal entities and assets distributed identity centralized identity distributed identity systems are the best fit to provide identity for individuals at large scale distributed identity systems are built to scale to large numbers of idps and rps enabling a full set of convenient and efficient transactions for users these systems protect user privacy and increase control by allowing users to choose which entities hold their information and by removing a single point of failure from the system centralized identity systems are suitable to provide identity for legal entities and assets on a large scale centralized identity systems offer a consolidated and standardized view of identity information and offer the single source of truth that is required for transactions involving legal entities and assets to deliver key value to external stakeholders such as regulators distributed identity distributed identity systems are also suited to provide identity for legal entities and assets on a large scale however these identity systems should have a wallet or aggregation layer that can provide a consolidated view of the user distributed identity solutions offer identity at scale and an aggregation layer provides the single view of the user required for legal entities and assets world economic forum the centralized and distributed identity archetypes would also solve many of the business challenges that fis are currently experiencing in retail small to mediumsized enterprise banking the need trusted uptodate individual identity information ability to access additional user attributes with consent ability to internally link identity information to provide a single view of the customer secure repositories for user information to prevent identity theft due to stolen data in corporate and investment banking the need trusted uptodate user identity information visibility into asset and user identity information ability to link asset entity identity and individual information ability to aggregate identity information across entities distributed identity distributed identity for individuals would allow fis to access trusted user information and link it back to a single user identity it would also ensure that user information would be securely stored with redundancy in the case of breach centralized identity distributed identity centralized identity and distributed identity with an aggregation layer for legal entities and assets would allow fis to have a consolidated trusted source of digital attributes for these users world economic forum configuring and implementing an identity system require many additional choices beyond archetype selection configuring an identity system requires choices to be made against a secondary set of dimensions that do not have the key functional and structural importance of the primary dimensions but have strong impact on how the system will operate the choices made against the secondary dimensions should therefore be tailored to suit the specific needs and requirements of the natural identity network illustrative secondary dimensions of choice types of idps and rps what types of entities are allowed to act as idps and rps in the identity system broker mechanism how are rp queries connected with idp attestations can the system support attribute exposure and attribute inquiry transactions does the system support transaction blinding data management where are data stored in a central database on a smart card on a distributed protocol eg blockchain are user attributes aggregated by a third party scaling is the system designed to scale beyond its initial set of applications business model what is the business model that supports the system who funds the system governance who is responsible for system governance and oversight who is responsible for system operation user rights what level of control do users have over the information that is held on the system who holds it and when and how it is shared note this is not an exhaustive list of choices many further choices must be made it is impossible to provide an exhaustive list of the secondary dimensions of choice in the configuration and implementation of an identity system or to give recommendations against each a set of guiding principles has therefore been developed to steer secondary decisionmaking and to assist in delivering a robust identity system that suits the needs of its stakeholders world economic forum guiding principles the guiding principles shape the choices that need to be made against the secondary set of dimensions a successful natural identity network is a product of the choices made against the secondary dimensions five principles inform decision making around these choices and guide the development of robust valueaccretive systems guiding principles for digital identity social good the system is designed as a social good that is available to all users and will deliver maximum benefit to a range of stakeholders privacyenhancing user information is only exposed to the right entities under the right circumstances usercentric users have control over their information and can determine who holds and accesses it viable and sustainable the system is sustainable as a business and is resilient to shifting political priorities open and flexible the system is built on open standards to allow scaling and development standards and guidelines are transparent to stakeholders world economic forum identity systems should provide identity to all users serve user interests and be accessible to all entities that wish to transact within them social good background the ability to prove identity allows users to be integrated into formal financial and social systems and engage in necessary and basic daytoday transactions digital identity should therefore be considered a social good to which all entities should have access implications the system should be designed to scale to all users and network stakeholders who wish to participate the public sector should have some involvement in defining the systems operating parameters and regulatory standards to ensure user interests are protected and to increase the scale of the system system access mechanisms eg mobile platforms should democratize access implications for fis fis have relationships with a large numbers of users this scale can act as a catalyst in driving system adoption and uptake fis have a key role to play in ensuring that identity systems are a tool to increase financial inclusion case studies sassa publicprivate partnership south africa the south african social security agency grindrod bank and mastercard have issued biometric enabled debit cards to over million social security recipients the sassa card holds an individuals personal information on the chip is authenticated through biometrics fingerprint and voice pattern or a personal identification number pin and is linked directly to a bank account where social grants are deposited the end result is over million people becoming financially included and huge efficiencies in the distribution of social grants in south africa world economic forum identity systems should be privacyenhancing protecting user information from illegitimate access accidental exposure and overexposure privacyenhancing background current identity systems put users at risk leaving user information vulnerable to privacy infringement data leakage and overexposure a digital identity system should protect user information ensuring that only what is needed is revealed to rps and that these parties are only using the data for the disclosed purposes implications all attributes including demonstrated behaviour and preferences should be covered in an identity system attribute transfer should use new information exchange protocols that allow endpoint blinding the brokerage mechanism that connects the endpoints of identity queries should allow only the minimum required information to complete attribute inquiry or attribute exposure transactions to be exposed to the rp attributes should only be stored by idps with adequate data security as defined by system standards users or custodians should have visibility into requested identity transactions and a defined recourse method if their information is being misused the storage of sensitive information should be noncentralized to reduce the severity of consequences and the impact on users in the event of a data breach implications for fis fis should build cyberresilient identity systems and meet standards set by the governance body around data protection and storage fis will need to seek user consent to gain access to or share attributes case studies tupas private identity solution finland in the finnish tupas system a set of fis act as idps and transfer user information on their behalf to rps the user has visibility into which attributes are being requested by the rp and must provide consent for the exchange to occur drivers licences government solutions global traditional drivers licences are a commonly used form of identity however they compromise privacy by permitting the rp to read all the users information rather than just the information required for the transaction world economic forum identity systems should give users control over the storage and transfer of their personal information usercentric background many identity systems have failed due to a lack of user uptake driven by concerns around the function and purposes of these systems a successful digital identity system that serves as a social good should place the user or the users custodians in control over identity information implications the mutuality of identity should be considered users or custodians must have clear visibility into who is requesting their information and for what purpose identity transactions should require consent exceptions must be clearly defined and communicated and users should be advised of when their information has been accessed users should be able to revoke consent users should have control over where their personal information is stored users should be able to easily update their information with idps implications for fis fis will be able to request identity information from users in order to tailor products and services fis will require user consent to share identity information case studies consensys private solution usa in the consensys system users are able to upload their information and have complete control over who their data are exposed to users do not choose who stores their data because all identity information is stored on uport a usercontrolled application that operates on the blockchain securekey concierge publicprivate solution canada the securekey concierge system allows canadian citizens to access government services online by authenticating through any of a large number of fis with which they already transact world economic forum identity systems should be designed as businesses that are viable and sustainable in the long term viable and sustainable background implementing a digital identity system represents a significant effort for all stakeholders stakeholders must have assurance that their investment will be worthwhile the system must therefore be designed as a viable and sustainable project implications the public sector should have some role in system development and implementation to represent user interest to drive uptake and to ensure regulatory participation the private sector should be involved in system development and implementation to provide executional ability and operational viability and ensure the system is costeffective both the public and private sectors should play a role in developing operational standards including liability and dispute resolution business model information collection storage and transfer levels of assurance technical requirements user consent models auditing implications for fis fis have a key role to play as important and trusted private entities in shaping the systems operational requirements and standards fis will have the opportunity to monetize identityasaservice world economic forum case studies national id cards government solution united kingdom the uk government introduced national id cards as a personal identification document the system was scrapped in january as the incoming government stated the system was wasteful bureaucratic and intrusive posing a significant threat to the privacy and security of personal information clarient entity hub dtcc private identity solution global clarient entity hub is a utility designed to manage data and regulatory complexity for parties engaging in financial transactions it aims to increase transparency across financial markets and is offered as a paid service to other entities identity systems should be built on open technology and data standards and should be designed to integrate new parties and serve changing user needs open and flexible background identity systems that are static and designed for a single purpose are by nature limited in scope and have low resilience to environmental changes a resilient identity system should accommodate changing requirements and integrate new parties implications the system must be built on open technology standards the system must be built on open data standards the system must have clear standards around idps and rps such that new entities can join the system and adhere to all standards and requirements the system must have a governance body that will continuously adapt requirements and standards and monitor system performance implications for fis open technology and data standards will reduce barriers to users switching institutions case studies xroad government solution estonia the estonian digital identity system is built on a common technology framework called x road this framework creates interoperability between different databases hugely increasing the digital identity systems functionality and effectiveness european union eidentity legislation public sector solution euwide the eu eidentity legislation sets requirements for member states issuing identity to citizens to ensure mutual recognition and scale of identity systems across europe world economic forum the established implications should help guide decisionmaking around configuring identity systems building a successful identity network is difficult a series of choices need to be made to ensure the system delivers value to all stakeholders and gains traction and acceptance the highestlevel considerations in the development of an identity system are the user group and the need that the system will serve and the archetype structure that should therefore be considered once these considerations have been settled the secondary dimensions of choice should be considered against the guiding principles of digital identity problems and user groups primary dimensions of choice secondary dimensions of choice the highest consideration is the user group and the problem that the identity system is designed to solve this will determine the limits of the natural identity network the user group and target problem will guide the selection of an appropriate identity archetype the guiding principles for identity and their implications will help determine what structural and configuration choices should be made against the secondary dimensions of choice world economic forum these implications are meaningful for entities within the digital identity network when configuring identity systems stakeholders will have a set of decisions to make at each stage of the process illustrative some open questions for identity stakeholders problems and user groups which user group does this system serve what problems will the system solve what unique characteristics will affect this user groups acceptance and use of an identity system which archetype is best suited to solve this problem primary dimensions of choice which entities should act as idps in this system what type of rps should be included in this system what type of information must be transferred in the system secondary dimensions of choice should the system use an identityasaservice feefortransaction business model what technology standard and trust framework will the system use what assurance model will the system use how will the governance body be organized what entities will be involved in system governance how will the user give consent in transactions will any exceptions to user consent requirements be allowed how will the public sector be engaged in shaping the operational standards world economic forum benefits the implementation of digital identity networks would benefit a set of different stakeholder groups identity systems that are constructed based on this guidance will deliver benefits both to the stakeholders involved directly in the identity network and to external stakeholders fis specifically would accrue deep benefit as a result of the implementation of digital identity stakeholder groups b identity providers c relying parties a users spotlight on financial institutions a b government regulators world economic forum what benefits would accrue to network stakeholders network stakeholders are parties who are involved in the core operation of the network itself the network stakeholders are users idps and rps a b c users identity providers relying parties privacy and control users are able to control who has access to their attributes revenue growth idps can charge fees for processing identity transactions information accuracy rps have access to trusted verified identity information world economic forum security user attributes are held in safe and secure locations decreased risk and liability idps understand their liability in the event of data loss or breach decreased transaction abandonment a streamlined user experience removes barriers to completing transactions convenience digital attribute transfer allows users to transact in an efficient manner competitive positioning idps can forge a strong relationship with users and position themselves as a critical part of the digital economy service tailoring rps can provide more tailored products and services transparency users have visibility into how and when their attributes are exposed improved products and services idps can use detailed and trusted customer information to deliver tailored services decreased risk and liability rps understand their liability in the event of data loss or breach service provision rps can differentiate between illicit and legitimate users what benefits would accrue to users users privacy and control users would have full control over which idps hold their attributes users consent would be required before idps could expose attributes to rps user data would not be sold by third parties the minimum amount of user information required would be transferred during transactions privacy and control security user attributes would only be held by entities meeting system standards and requirements for information handling and storage digital attribute storage would make identity information resistant to damage destruction or loss users would have the ability to disperse their identity information creating contingency if an idp suffered a data breach or data were erased or stolen and reducing the impact of a data breach on the user convenience digital identity and digital attribute transfer would simplify and improve the user experience in transactions eliminating the need for users to track multiple authentication methods eg usernames and passwords and manually submit personal information during transactions attributes would be transferred digitally removing the potential for human error and subsequent information remediation users would be able to easily update information held with their idps and would not have to deal with transactions being executed based on inaccurate or outofdate information transparency users would have visibility into which attributes would be exposed and to what entity during identity transactions security convenience transparency world economic forum what benefits would accrue to users users case study estonias egovernment system protects citizen information provides an extremely convenient experience for users and allows them to feel ownership over their data egovernment government solution estonia the government of estonia has created a digital interface between citizens and government agencies the government holds citizen information in a centralized population registry and acts as the idp and governing body transferring reliable and trusted data to rps citizens are each assigned an eid identifier that they can use to log on to the state portal which provides access to dozens of services from voting to updating automobile registries to applying to universities the government transfers the attribute information needed to complete each transaction from the population registry to the rp and citizens are able to see what entities have accessed their information citizens of estonia have the ability to view who has accessed their records how often and for what purpose this transparency allows citizens to feel ownership over their data as they are able to see how the information is being used a compelling example is the electronic health record a nationwide system that integrates data from various healthcare providers into a single portal users are able to log on to a patient portal to control their treatment and manage their healthcare information chekk allows users to own manage and share their personal information chekk private sector solution global chekk is a mobile solution that provides users with a secure wallet of their personal attributes and allows them to share uptodate information with the entities with which they transact in the chekk system only the information required for a transaction is supplied meaning that the user is in control and their privacy is protected world economic forum what benefits would accrue to idps identity providers revenue growth idps would complete identity transactions for rps this would allow them to monetize identityasaservice through pertransaction fees or other business models defined risk and liability liability guidelines would be clearly defined and communicated idps would be clear about their liability in the event of data loss or breach or contravention of the standards for identity provision competitive positioning idps would be able to forge a strong relationship with users and position themselves as a critical part of the digital economy given their unique insight into users and their established position of trust improved products and services of services that idps could securely provide online idps would have increased access to detailed and reliable user information that would allow them to better tailor processes products and services idps could begin to draw on nonstandard user attributes to better manage and evaluate risk eg health records secure digital identity protocols and digital attribute transfer would improve user experience and expand the number revenue growth defined risk and liability competitive positioning improved products and services world economic forum what benefits would accrue to idps identity providers case study a set of banks act as idps in the tupas system providing individuals with access to over public and private services tupas private sector solution finland the federation of finnish financial services drove the creation of a bank identity system called tupas designed to improve user access to online services the rps pay for the service initiation fees monthly fees and fees for set transaction volumes users may also be charged on a monthly basis depending on their relationship with their bank while a group of telecoms in finland offer a competing service as of february of all online service logins were processed through tupas only of online service logins were processed through the competing system this may be due to the governments strong adoption of tupas citizen loyalty towards government and banks or the fact that it was the first successful service in the region tupas has established a new revenue stream for banks as well as a strong competitive position with most banks the user must approve and certify that the data being transferred from the bank to the rp are accurate eliminating any liability risk for the idp world economic forum what benefits would accrue to rps relying parties information accuracy rps would have access to trusted verified identity information matched to the level of assurance required for their products or services this would eliminate the need for information remediation and for information crosschecks through paid thirdparty services digital attribute exchange would eliminate the potential for human error in transactions information accuracy service tailoring rps would be able to provide more tailored products and services to users by requesting access to identity information beyond what they would traditionally require to complete transactions service provision more reliable and accurate identity protocols would give rps greater ability to differentiate between illicit and legitimate users and to deny or provide services accordingly decreased transaction abandonment a more streamlined user experience would remove barriers to completing transactions eg forgotten login information required account creation rejected billing information and would therefore reduce the rates of users transaction abandonment decreased risk and liability liability guidelines would be clearly defined and communicated rps would be clear about their liability in the event of data loss or breach or contravention of the standards for identity provision service tailoring service provision decreased transaction abandonment decreased risk and liability world economic forum what benefits would accrue to rps relying parties case study the population registry is a central database that stores identity information the data are trusted by many entities in finland as a comprehensive source of uptodate information about citizens assets and legal entities population registry government programme finland the population registry is a national database owned and maintained by the finnish government the government acts as the idp transferring attributes to public and private rps citizens are required to provide uptodate information to the population registry such that idps can trust that the information they are receiving is accurate public rps that require attributes to complete transactions can use citizens national id numbers to access data held in the population registry the necessary attributes are transferred digitally from the registry to the rp private rps can also subscribe to the population registry and access information with consent to provide better products and services to their users world economic forum what benefits would accrue to external stakeholders external stakeholders are parties that are not involved in the systems daytoday operation but are key stakeholders in the system the external stakeholders are governments and regulators a governments b regulators process streamlining and efficiency governments can more efficiently interact with their citizens saving time and money tracing of assets regulators can more effectively trace asset origination and ownership improved service delivery governments can more easily identify and deliver services to various groups of citizens transparent view of entities regulators can access an aggregated view of legal entities across their hierarchies improved compliance data standardization regulators can access trusted uptodate

economic forum what benefits would accrue to governments governments process streamlining and efficiency governments would be able to more efficiently interact with their citizens saving time and money in the delivery of services such as tax filing and the distribution of social assistance improved service delivery governments would be able to leverage accurate identity information to more easily identify the individuals and entities that are eligible to access given services governments would be able to easily identify and deliver services to those who might be financially or socially excluded due to the lack of traditional identity information process streamlining and efficiency improved service delivery world economic forum what benefits would accrue to governments governments case study the aadhaar programme was introduced in india to increase social and financial inclusion by providing identity for all indians residents many of whom previously had no means of proving their identities aadhaar government programme india the aadhaar card was developed to improve financial inclusion in the country the unique identification authority of india uidai acts as the central idp controlling who has access to the data that they collect and store to receive a card individuals submit various documents to a local registrar if they are unable to provide documentation an introducer such as an elected representative or a local teacher or doctor can vouch for the persons identity this parallel process decreases the chance of uidai storing inaccurate information or providing social services to illegal immigrants or other illicit actors the uidai has a database that holds information such as name date of birth and biometrics data that may include a photograph fingerprint iris scan or other information the aadhaar program has been very effective in increasing financial inclusion with over billion people enrolled for accounts however there are still some outstanding concerns about information protection and privacy the estonian eresidency program allows nonestonian citizens to gain digital residency in the country eresidency government programme estonia the eresidency program allows nonestonian citizens to get a digital id card that enables them to use estonian private and public services and to use secure digital signatures the purpose of the program is to create a virtual business environment and continue to position estonia as a hub of the digital world since its inception in december almost people have applied for eresidency and over have established an new company domiciled in estonia world economic forum what benefits would accrue to regulators regulators tracing of assets transparent view of entities improved compliance data standardization tracing of assets regulators would be able to more effectively trace asset origination and ownership increasing their ability to track the proceeds of criminal activity asset rehypothecation could be traced ensuring that assets would not be rehypothecated beyond their total value transparent view of entities regulators would have access to an aggregated view of legal entities across their hierarchies increasing their ability to evaluate systemic risk and manage stability improved compliance access to trusted identity information would increase the ability of fis to be compliant with antimoney laundering knowyourcustomer and other regulations within their jurisdiction access to trusted information on legal entity and asset identity would allow fis to more accurately detect money laundering and other suspicious transactions access to trusted digital attributes would allow fis to automate their compliance processes to some degree potentially allowing regulators to increase the required frequency of compliance reviews data standardization data collection and storage could be standardized across all fis reducing friction in data aggregation world economic forum what benefits would accrue to regulators regulators case study gleif is an organization that supports the implementation of the legal entity identifier standard this standard might ultimately become a common thread between identifier systems in an effort to create a standardized global view of legal entities global legal entity identifier foundation gleif nonprofit organization global gleif manages a network of local operating units that issue legal entity identifiers leis to legal entities worldwide legal entities engaging in financial transactions submit a standard set of attributes to a local operating unit which validates them against thirdparty records and then issues an lei gleif holds the master file of all leis and associated entity information the system was introduced by financial regulators to improve micro and macroprudential risk assessment and management increase market transparency and improve the accuracy of financial data beyond financial services and regulation the goal of the lei system is to provide reliable identity information to permit unique identification of legal entities worldwide in financial services and beyond eg supply chain applications over leis have been issued since october the lei is intended to become the link between all other identifier systems eg knowyourcustomer systems business register codes etc this would allow regulators to have a consistent and comprehensive view of all legal entities and financial instruments globally world economic forum fis have key features that would give them structural advantages within identity systems fis have unique advantages that make them wellsuited to playing key roles in digital identity networks advantages of fis in digital identity fis are highly reliant

institutions that already store user identity securekey concierge publicprivate programme canada securekey partnered with nine banks that are trusted and hold accurate data this data can be used to authenticate individuals in the system what benefits would accrue to fis from the implementation of digital identity the benefits to fis of implementing digital identity fall into six categories improved products and services fis will be able to use detailed and trusted customer information to deliver tailored services to customers financial institutions improved compliance digital attribute handling and greater access to user identity will allow fis to complete compliance processes more easily and accurately operational efficiency digital attribute transfer and handling will allow fis to streamline and automate many processes eliminating human error decreased fraud the secure digital storage of user information will reduce fraud resulting from stolen information or compromised authentication revenue growth fis will have the opportunity to increase revenue from improved products and services as well as to offer identityasaservice better user experience and competitive positioning fis can offer a streamlined user experience and position themselves as a critical part of the digital economy world economic forum what benefits would accrue to fis from the implementation of digital identity financial institutions improved products and services fis would have increased access to detailed and reliable user information that would allow them to better tailor processes products and services such as risk scoring for insurance products financial advisory asset management credit scoring loan adjudication improved products and services operational efficiency fis could begin to draw on trusted information with consent to better manage and evaluate risk secure digital identity protocols and digital attribute transfer would improve user experience and expand the number of services that fis could securely provide online operational efficiency fis would be able to access user information in a consolidated digital form through queries in the digital identity network having attributes in a consolidated digital form would provide a single view of the customer and allow fis to streamline customerfacing operations such as onboarding as well as many backend processes digital identity for assets would allow fis to track financial products and assets more closely through greater visibility into ownership and the resolution of rehypothecation concerns decreased fraud user information would be held only by entities that follow standards around data protection this would reduce fraud such as cardnotpresent transactions made using shipping and billing information stolen in largescale data breaches digital authentication methods would reduce fraud resulting from hacked or compromised user accounts decreased fraud world economic forum what benefits would accrue to fis from the implementation of digital identity financial institutions improved compliance digital identity would give fis access to trusted uptodate attribute information for users improving the accuracy of knowyourcustomer processes digital information transfer and storage would allow fis to complete their compliance processes more quickly and easily allowing faster processing and reducing time spent on information remediation and correcting human error compliance processes could be automated and executed on more regular cycles digital identity would give fis better visibility into corporate ownership structures and the identity of corporate directors to improve corporate knowyourcustomer processes digital identity would give fis better visibility into asset origination and ownership revenue growth fis could monetize identityasaservice through business models such as subscription fees with rps or feefor transaction services for highassurance identity transactions including authentication digital signatures the completion of identity transactions for rps such as providing attribute information eg providing shipping information to merchants or providing information about attributes eg attesting to a merchant that a user is over a certain age based on date of birth better user experience and competitive positioning by collaborating with governments public sector entities and other private sector entities fis would become part of a trusted ecosystem working on developing the digital economy as trusted safeguards of user information

offers fis improved and new capabilities beyond the firstlevel benefits of digital identity that fis would receive as a result of participating in an identity system we have explored some futurelooking use cases that illustrate additional capabilities that digital identity might offer to fis potential futurestate applications tailored risk profiles international resettlement attributes tied to payment tokens digital tax filing determining total risk exposure identifying transaction counterparties linking individual identity to corporate identity tracking total asset rehypothecation world economic forum what additional capabilities can digital identity offer to fis tailored risk profiles international resettlement current state fis currently create risk profiles for individuals and legal entities using the limited information that is collected when customers are onboarded and predictive algorithms to provide relevant and tailored products and services to their customers current state todays onboarding processes require every fi to onboard a customer from a zeroknowledge state resulting in difficulty opening accounts for entities that are unable to prove their identities and disregard of financial history how would digital identity help fis could leverage trusted user attributes with a users consent to more effectively build risk profiles for their customers and therefore tailor credit and riskbased products this enhanced user experience would ultimately lead to increased customer stickiness and offer growth opportunities for fis how would digital identity help users could transport their digital identity across jurisdictions and use it to easily gain access to financial and other services in their new place of residence the attestations and attributes held by the users original fis would serve as the basis for new fis to become idps this would eliminate the need for the recipient fi to perform the costly and labourintensive knowyourcustomer process that would otherwise be required in addition it would reduce the time and effort needed for fis to onboard users and allow them to incorporate trusted historical information world economic forum what additional capabilities can digital identity offer to fis attributes tied to payment tokens digital tax filing current state when completing transactions customers are required to manually provide their attributes eg confirmation of age shipping information or proof of attributes to merchants at the point of sale how would digital identity help fis could automatically provide customer attributes to merchants streamlining and securing the transaction process for the merchant and customer the digital transfer of attributes would eliminate the potential for human error in information transfer and dramatically reduce information remediation and transaction abandonment for the rp note this automatic transfer of attributes could be supported by an additional factor of authentication eg mobile or behavioural authentication to prevent fraud current state individuals and businesses currently file their taxes based on the aggregation of pieces of information from multiple sources eg fis employers educational institutions etc how would digital identity help in collaboration with governments taxes could be automatically completed and filings generated by customers chosen fis using their complete knowledge of customers financial holdings assets income and personal circumstances with user consent all of this information would be available through a robust digital identity network this would allow the typically complex and tedious tax filing process to be completed efficiently and accurately world economic forum what additional capabilities can digital identity offer to fis determining total risk exposure identifying transaction counterparties current state legal entities are often unable to determine their total risk exposure to a given counterpart due to complicated ownership structures and difficulty aggregating a complete view of a legal entity current state it is currently challenging or impossible for entities to identify all entities that are participating in a given transaction they may not have visibility into the end customer in a transaction that is being completed by a broker or other counterparty how would digital identity help transaction counterparties could have a consolidated view of the corporate structure of the entities with which they are transacting allowing them to determine their total risk exposure to that entity across transactions and lines of business how would digital identity help legal entities could request visibility into the consolidated identity of a third party and the ownership history of a given asset involved in a transaction this would allow them to identify both the direct customer and the end customer in the transaction better informing the decision of whether to complete the transaction world economic forum what additional capabilities can digital identity offer to fis linking individual identity to corporate identity tracking total asset rehypothecation current state individual and corporate identity information is currently not linked it is challenging to identify individuals who are associated with corporate entities how would digital identity help the digital and standardized collection storage and transfer of attributes for both individuals and legal entities would ensure identity information is accurate and uptodate linkages between these systems would create reliable pictures of the identities of individuals affiliated with legal entities for knowyourcustomer and other purposes current state the transaction and ownership history of assets can become ambiguous as assets are rehypothecated this exacerbates counterparty risk and asset valuation uncertainty while the lack of a historical tracking mechanism prevents the enforcement of limits on the extent of asset rehypothecation how would digital identity help consolidated standardized and digital identity information for assets would be available to all entities engaging in a transaction involving that asset giving transaction counterparties the ability to check asset information such as issuer and transaction history this would enable the tracking of the asset ownership structure and composition and prevent overrehypothecation due to the lack of visibility into past transactions involving that asset world economic forum implementation of identity systems implementation of a digital identity system should follow a bottomup approach we have outlined our perspective on the prime movers within digital identity solutions and how they should implement digital identity solutions it is critical to observe that this is the first step in a bottomup approach that would result in systems being scaled outwards to incorporate greater numbers of users relying parties and identity providers as guidelines and functionality are tested and refined the system is launched with a critical mass of parties to test and refine the system is scaled to increasing numbers of users relying parties and identity providers global identity will never exist as a monolith this document has laid out a principlesbased approach to building effective sustainable and bounded natural identity networks as the foundation for interconnecting individual identity networks there will never be a single global solution for identity identity serves different needs different user groups have different needs and requirements for identity identity systems for individuals are designed to increase the ability of users to perform transactions in a safe and secure manner identity systems for legal entities are intended to enable comprehensive aggregation at a macro level whether to determine total exposure to a single legal entity or manage systematic risk and stability identity systems for assets are designed to allow tracking and provide transparency around ownership and value privacy is one of the key requirements of individual identity but is much less important in legal entity and asset identity and may even interfere with the larger purposes of these systems individuals have selfdetermination whereas legal entities and assets have custodians who act on their behalf identity is cultural identity is hugely affected by cultural and geopolitical factors for example while some populations are comfortable having a national id card this system has failed in other jurisdictions certain authorities may not be a stable government to drive the creation and adoption of digital identity this means that aside from having different configurations for purely practical reasons identity systems will differ dramatically to suit the cultural and geopolitical needs that they serve there is no onesizefitsall for identity world economic forum a global system for identity therefore initially requires the construction of discrete identity networks and then the creation of rails between them creating a global solution for identity is a twostep process the key to building a global system for digital identity is first building successful natural identity networks that address the unique needs and preferences of their user group and situation and then building connective tissue that creates interoperability between these systems implementation configuring natural identity networks interconnection building the rails for global identity the configuration of natural identity networks will be guided by the decisions made against the primary and secondary dimensions of choice building the rails between natural identity systems will create global interconnection and interoperability world economic forum while the rails for global identity will begin to emerge as systems develop it is important that entities follow a guiding framework building identity as a twostep process enables identity systems to be built by narrowing the required stakeholders to groups that have similar needs and concerns and therefore have relatively aligned incentives it also ensures that these systems are tailored to the specific needs and wants of their user and stakeholder groups and will therefore gain the uptake that a topdown onesizefitsall system would not attain however these solutions should also be built following a common framework that will ensure interoperability by defining the features attributes and requirements of the identities that are exchanged in the system this reinforces the need for individual identity systems to be built by entities such as financial institutions that have experience working together to define standards and then building individual systems within these standards implementing discrete digital identity systems that suit the unique needs and cultural factors of users in their own jurisdictions and designing these systems around resilience interoperability and interconnection will allow a global blueprint for digital identity to emerge world economic forum there are many standing questions and uncertainties that must be considered in the creation of new identity systems some thought starters to building identity solutions drivers of identity systems will need to consider many detailed tactical questions in the configuration and implementation of their own identity solutions we have provided some example questions and uncertainties below which entities need to be involved in an identity system for your area and user group governments regulators financial institutions consumer groups others what business model that will be sustainable in that situation user pays relying party pays government pays by transaction subscription subsidized through other services what governance structure is necessary for the system who should be involved what should be the extent of their mandate how will governance be renewed and refreshed what is the minimum viable identity product required for that situation what users should be involved what services need to be covered which entities should be involved what metrics are being tested which frameworks and standards can be adopted for the identity system which components of the identity stack must be proprietary and which ones can be outsourced or obtained through partnership what technology platform is required for the system what is the best method of communicating system functionality and benefits to users

joerg weydanz market color digital production the value web event facilitation level location services executive summary the mandate of this project was to explore the transformative potential of new entrants and innovations on business models in financial services project context we set out to address three major problems that have prevented a comprehensive understanding of the state of disruptive innovation in the industry there is no common taxonomy or understanding of which innovations are the most relevant there is no clear understanding of the evolutionary path of emerging innovations the implications of those evolutions on incumbent business models are unclear creating significant uncertainty for traditional players as they strive to react to growing competitive pressures we structured our research around three main questions each requiring distinct actions project approach which emerging innovations are the most impactful and relevant to the financial services industry action we identified key clusters of innovations based on how they impact the core functions of financial services how will these innovations impact the ways in which financial services are structured provisioned and consumed in the future action we considered a range of scenarios for the degree and nature of impact each cluster of innovation could have what would be the implications of these changes on customers financial institutions and the overall financial services industry action we analysed the implications of each scenario on customers incumbent institutions and the overall financial services ecosystem over months of research we engaged with industry leaders and innovators through interviews and multistakeholder workshops industry leaders innovators oversight guidance and thought leadership from csuite executives and strategy officers of global financial institutions inperson and phone interviews with innovative new entrants and subject matter experts facilitated six multistakeholder workshops at global financial hubs with total participants including industry leaders innovators subject matter experts and regulators global workshops hong kong sar sep tianjin china sep boston usa sep new york usa oct london uk dec davos switzerland jan the outcome of this work is the first consolidated taxonomy for disruptive innovation in financial services research framework we have structured our framework against six functions of financial services and eleven clusters of innovation functions of financial services even in an environment of rapid change to the design delivery and providers of financial services the core needs those services fulfill remain the same we have identified six core functions that comprise financial services payments market provisioning investment management insurance deposits lending capital raising clusters of innovation we have identified clusters of innovation exerting pressure on traditional business models we have synthesised six high level insights on innovation in financial services key research findings innovation in financial services is deliberate and predictable where the greatest sources of customer friction meet the largest profit pools incumbent players are most likely to be attacked innovations are having the greatest impact where they employ business models that are platform based data intensive and capital light the most imminent effects of disruption will be felt in the banking sector however the greatest impact of disruption is likely to be felt in the insurance sector incumbent institutions will employ parallel strategies aggressively competing with new entrants while also leveraging legacy assets to provide those same new entrants with infrastructure and access to services collaboration between regulators incumbents and new entrants will be required to understand how new innovations alter the risk profile of the industry positively and negatively disruption will not be a onetime event rather a continuous pressure to innovate that will shape customer behaviours business models and the longterm structure of the financial services industry in the following pages we have summarised our insights by function and cluster this section provides a summary of our findings divided by function and clusters within the functions for each cluster of innovation we have defined the major disruptive trends summarized the impact and examined key implications for institutions in that function and cluster insight summary reading guide function grouping innovation cluster key trends driving disruption in financial services business model summary of the activity that the cluster of innovation is creating major implications for financial institutions as a result of activity within the cluster key findings payments cashless world emerging payment rails key disruptive trends key disruptive trends mobile payments streamlined payments integrated billing next generation security cryptographic protocols pp transfers mobile money summary new consumer functionalities are being built on existing payment systems and will result in meaningful changes in customer behaviour summary the greatest potential for cryptocurrencies may be to radically streamline the transfer of value rather than as store of value implications for financial institutions financial institutions may lose control over their customers transaction experience as payments become more integrated implications for financial institutions as more efficient alternative rails are adopted the role of traditional intermediaries as a trusted party may diminish with reduced visibility becoming the default card among specific customer segments will become critical financial institutions may face a new set of risks eg reputation security and regulatory issues as they participate in new rails winning issuers will be able to gain visibility into more of customers spending patterns build more holistic understanding of customers and create more competitive offerings applications of these technologies can expand beyond money transfer to modernise other financial infrastructures key findings insurance insurance disaggregation connected insurance key disruptive trends key disruptive trends disaggregated distribution sharing economy selfdriving cars rd party capital smarter cheaper sensors wearables internetofthings standardised platforms summary emergence of online insurance marketplaces and homogenisation of risks will force big changes in insurers strategies summary ubiquity of connected devices will enable insurers to highly personalise insurance and proactively manage clients risks implications for financial institutions in an increasingly commoditised environment the risks of customers being more fickle will increase and creating loyalty through innovation will become more important insurers ability to benchmark against competitors will become more important as customers gain ability to comparisonshop with increased margin pressure insurers will need to increase their size by expanding either scope or scale implications for financial institutions as customer relationships evolve from shortterm productbased to longterm advisory capturing customers early on becomes critical as insurers become a hub for customer data their strategic value within fullservice financial institutions will grow forming partnerships with data providers device manufacturers and other ecosystem participants will be critical to enable connected insurance key findings deposits lending alternative lending shifting customer preferences key disruptive trends key disruptive trends pp lean automated processes alternative adjudication virtual banking banking as platform api evolution of mobile banking summary new lending platforms are transforming credit evaluation and loan origination as well as opening up consumer lending to non traditional sources of capital summary new entrants will make meeting customer demands more important creating an imperative for banks to reconsider their roles implications for financial institutions intensified competition will narrow spread between deposits and loans decreasing financial institutions profitability implications for financial institutions financial products will increasingly be offered on a standalone basis limiting incumbents ability to competitively crosssubsidise as savers turn to alternative platforms traditional deposits and investment products will be eroded financial institutions ability to collaborate with nontraditional players and other institutions will become essential distribution of customers credit portfolio over a large number of alternative platforms may make it difficult to measure customers creditworthiness financial institutions will need to choose where they will specialise and where they will leverage external partners eg product manufacturing vs creation of customer experience key findings capital raising crowdfunding key disruptive trends empowered angel investors alternative adjudication summary crowdfunding platforms are widening access to capital raising activities making the overall ecosystem richer implications for financial institutions access to more diverse funding options allow new companies to grow at a quicker pace and shorten the average time between early funding stages distribution platforms create a venue for investors to tailor their investment portfolio across dimensions beyond financial return as the barriers to enter the asset class fall it becomes ever more important for traditional intermediaries profitability to find undiscovered start investments key findings investment management empowered investors process externalisation key disruptive trends key disruptive trends social trading automated advice wealth management retail algorithmic trading advanced analytics natural language processasa service capability sharing summary roboadvisors are improving accessibility to sophisticated financial management and creating margin pressure forcing traditional advisors to evolve summary the scope of externalisable processes is expanding giving financial institutions access to the new levels of efficiency and sophistication implications for financial institutions new entrants will place pressure on margins and intensify competition among traditional players in more specialised segments implications for financial institutions the ability to access sophisticated capabilities without large infrastructure investments flattens the playing field for midsized institutions as more advisory functions become automated distributing wealth products via proprietary advisory channels will become less effective as new entrants widen the access for mass customers they will compete for customers traditional savings deposits organisational agility will become critical to sustain competitiveness as highvalue capabilities are continued to be commoditised externalisation of capabilities may result in workforce skill loss by preventing the development of a holistic view of operations key findings market provisioning smarter faster machines new market platforms key disruptive trends key disruptive trends machine accessible data artificial intelligence machine learning big data fixed income funds fund of funds private equity venture capital shares private company shares commodities derivative contracts summary as the popularity of high frequency trading declines the focus of algorithmic trading may shift to smarter faster response to real life events summary new information platforms are improving connectivity among market constituents making the markets more liquid accessible and efficient implications for financial institutions the impacts of eventdriven algorithmic trading on liquidity spread and systemic stability are unclear with endtoend trading activities automated even small errors in data integrity trade strategy and execution will lead to large impacts regulators have the potential to significantly alter the course of developments in this area implications for financial institutions as traditional differentiators among intermediaries eg ability to discover counterparty become commoditised the importance of advisory services will increase information platforms will evolve the standards for bestexecution from a bestefforts basis to more quantifiable and comparable metrics we identified six important themes that cut across functions and touch multiple clusters of innovation streamlined infrastructure emerging platforms and decentralised technologies provide new ways to aggregate and analyse information improving connectivity and reducing the marginal costs of accessing information and participating in financial activities automation of highvalue activities many emerging innovations leverage advanced algorithms and computing power to automate activities that were once highly manual allowing them to offer cheaper faster and more scalable alternative products and services reduced intermediation emerging innovations are streamlining or eliminating traditional institutions role as intermediaries and offering lower prices and or higher returns to customers the strategic role of data emerging innovations allow financial institutions to access new data sets such as social data that enable new ways of understanding customers and markets niche specialised products new entrants with deep specialisations are creating highly targeted products and services increasing competition in these areas and creating pressure for the traditional endtoend financial services model to unbundle customer empowerment emerging innovations give customers access to previously restricted assets and services more visibility into products and control over choices as well as the tools to become prosumers at the conclusion of the research phase the steering committee gave us a mandate to dive more deeply into highpotential areas of disruption next steps we have identified three major challenge areas related to innovation in financial services that will require multistakeholder collaboration to be addressed effectively we are launching a project stream related to each area with the goal of enabling tangible impact the forum is uniquely positioned to support advancements against each challenge due to its ability to convene senior multistakeholder groups and align diverse perspectives create thought leadership on cuttingedge issues with longterm implications to the industry challenges projects new financial products and services are creating significant regulatory uncertainty and fueling perceptions of regulatory arbitrage regulatory models for innovation decentralised systems such as the blockchain protocol threaten to disintermediate almost every process in financial services applications of decentralised systems outdated identity management protocols create risks and inefficiencies for both service providers and consumers blueprint for digital identity we will be presenting outcomes from these projects in early reading guide for the detailed sections of the report the following detailed sections of the report are organised based on key innovation clusters and how they map to the core functions of financial services we have analysed the relevant cluster of innovations for each key area of impact and developed scenarios that present potential answers report structure a background context b analysis of innovations c future characteristics d scenarios brief analysis of current state business models and processes in the impacted function summary of historical developments key pain points and challenges with the current state key characteristics of future models of financial services enabled by innovations for the impacted function overview of key innovations impacting the topic key characteristics of the innovations impact of the innovations on the current state value chain comparison of the current state models and innovations summary of potential outcomes related to the key question for the topic in a scenario format narratives and case studies to further illustrate each scenario necessary conditions required for each scenario to be realised implications of the scenario on customers incumbents and overall industry key opportunities and risks associated with the scenario key insights from the analysis of each topic and relevant cluster of innovations have been summarised in the executive summary and conclusions pages in each module detailed research modules payments how will customer needs and behaviours change in an increasingly cashless payments landscape payments cashless world executive summary context innovation a number of innovations have emerged in the past five years leveraging mobile devices and connectivity to make payments simpler and more valuable examples range from digital wallets to automated machinetomachine payments the majority of these innovations will modify frontend processes to improve the customer and merchant experience while leaving the underlying payments infrastructure undisrupted future of payments these innovations will reduce the use of cash and make payments less visible to payers they will also enable financial institutions and merchants to use datadriven customer engagement platforms as more payment solutions allow customers to link their bank accounts for direct payment and seamless pointofsale vendor financing the use of credit cards could be displaced by these platforms customers may lose visibility into their payment choices increasing their default cards share of wallet and reducing the importance of some traditional differentiators like brand and design the elimination of a need to carry physical cards and the emergence of payment decision support systems could support the proliferation of niche and merchant issued cards splintering wallet share among many cards key implications success of any innovative payment solution will require a strong customer rationale to switch as most customers do not consider the existing payment regime to be broken in an increasingly cashless future payment providers who can embrace emerging payment innovations to offer differentiated valueadding digital experiences will be able to deepen their relationships with customers and take a dominant place in the changing market landscape payments cashless world the payments industry has continuously evolved over time but there are still some challenges to make the world cashless since the introduction of credit cards in the s debit cards in the s and the rise of ecommerce through the s electronic payments have grown in popularity displacing cash and cheques in they accounted for percent of us transactions in value history of the payments industry electronic transactions rely on a number of intermediaries which provide acceptance convenience and security of transactions and are generally coordinated by large scalebased payment networks customer point of sale pos acquirer merchant issuer payment network payment credentials authentication benefits of electronic transactions key challenges inhibiting the cashless world convenience reduces the need for customers and merchants to carry cash reducing associated costs including trips to banks price inflexibility and opportunity costs ie interest earned efficiency reduces the cash management costs for businesses and financial institutions as fewer bills are exchanged by hand and money movements are settled electronically traceability enables a greater degree of visibility into the flow of money for financial institutions and regulators facilitating taxation transparency and information gathering protection protects customers and merchants from fraud and theft by documenting transaction records and reducing the need to hold cash merchant adoption electronic payments are not accepted by every merchant due to the infrastructure costs high fees and settlement delays convenience small denomination payments are often still conducted reducing the number of processing steps and time to complete a transaction accessibility underbanked population does not have access to primary accounts and therefore only uses cash in transactions fraud despite the safety measures increasingly adopted electronic transactions create opportunities for fraudulent activities payments cashless world a number of payments innovations have emerged in the past five years leveraging mobile and connectivity to make payments simpler and add value key innovations for the cashless world mobile payments integrated billing streamlined payments next generation security mobile wallets mobilebased merchant payment solutions mobile ordering payment apps integrated mobile shopping apps locationbased payments geotagging biometrics locationbased identification machinetomachine payments tokenisation standards order ahead common characteristics of successful payments innovations simplicity interoperability valueadd services payments innovations allow customers to make payments in a single tap or automatically by leveraging connectivity eg wireless network nearfield communications most innovative payment solutions are not restricted to a single payment method allowing customers to manage and use a variety of credit cards debit cards or bank accounts for payment many innovative solutions offer valueadd functionalities in addition to payments enabling merchants and financial institutions to interact more closely with customers and deliver additional value eg loyalty offers payments cashless world most payment innovations do not disrupt the existing payment processes but rather modify frontend processes to improve customer and merchant experience how different types of innovative payment solutions interact with todays payment process how they work illustrative diagram examples openloop mobile payment solutions closedloop mobile payment solutions allows for increased consumer access by using existing payment network ecosystem to connect to parties already on the platform including a large number of merchants and make payments more convenient for customers leveraging new form factors eg nfc qr code consolidates the pos acquirer and payment network as a single entity to create a more flexible experience requiring consumers issuers and merchants to participate often allows consumers to fund transactions via the traditional payment network ecosystem mobile merchant payment solutions integrated payment apps streamlined payment solutions aims to replace or complement the current pos infrastructure by leveraging mobile connectivity and aggregate transactions in some cases to make the payments process more effortless and accessible by more merchants enhance customer pos acquirer merchant issuer payment network consolidate customer pos acquirer issuer merchant replace complement or enhance payment network customer pos acquirer merchant issuer payment network payment credentials authentication payments cashless world innovations will make payments more cashless and invisible in the future while enabling datadriven engagement platforms for customers key characteristics of the future of payments cashless more cash will be displaced by electronic transactions as payments innovations make it beneficial for customers to use payment cards even in small denomination transactions back of mind as more transactions become virtual and automated more payments processes will become invisible to end customers changing their needs and behaviours engagement as payments and mobility becomes more integrated the importance of payment transactions as a potential customer interaction point will increase for merchants and financial institutions datadriven with greater adoption of electronic payments more data will be accumulated from payment transactions allowing financial institutions services providers and merchants to gain greater understanding of customers and businesses increased access to loans as more payments are processed through electronic rails financial institutions visibility into individuals and businesses cashflow and spending patterns will increase improving their ability to extend loans to customers previously less understood reduced costs because innovative solutions build on the existing infrastructure which has very low variable costs the cost of making electronic transactions will fall as electronic payments gain more volume as innovations change customer behaviours by making payments more effortless and provide financial institutions and merchants with data what will be the payments landscape in the future payments cashless world how will changing customer needs and behaviours in an increasingly cashless world change the payments landscape consolidation of the payment market fragmentation of the payment market displacement of credit cards potential impact on the payments landscape today customers customers future bank account cards default card bank account today bank account today bank account payment solutions payment solutions merchants customers merchants customers cards cards payment solutions payment solutions merchants customers cards merchants customers payment solutions payment solutions merchants merchants future bank account future bank account key change to payment behaviour customers lose visibility into their payment choices as innovations like amazons click and ubers seamless payments push more and more transactions to a single default card the default cards share of wallet will increase and the importance of differentiators like card brand and design will be reduced the successful deployment of digital wallets eliminates the need to owncarry physical cards and enable decision support systems to help customers optimise card usage this drives a proliferation of niche and merchant issued cards splintering share of wallet across many providers customers with revolving balances elect to use innovative point of sale vendor financing schemes offering preferable terms credit card usage is eroded as transactional card users migrate to payment solutions that seamlessly link to their bank accounts the following scenarios illustrate potential outcomes generated by the innovations discussed in this topic particularly in response to the key question above they are not meant to be future predictions these scenarios are illustrations of particular aspects of the potential future and are not meant to represent a complete view of the market and competitive landscape in many cases some or all scenarios could be realised at the same time payments cashless world scenario consolidation of the payment market today future customers customers bank account bank account cards default card payment solutions payment solutions merchants merchants narrative summary of impact to avoid moments of truth in customer decisionmaking more merchants and payment solutions will adopt an automated or oneclick onetouch one tap checkout in both virtual and physical marketplaces these seamless checkout environments will rely on a default card that will be used unless customers make a conscious choice to change cards as a result default cards will become significantly stickier and receive a higher share of total customer spend card issuers will respond to the changing landscape by developing products that provide the best loyalty points and benefits in aggregate to compete for the role of the default card customers lose the desire to regularly use a variety of cards as payment innovations enable a seamless transaction experience in one click onetouch or less driven by simplicity and convenience customers push more transactions to a single default card increasing the default cards share of wallet as customers desire to switch cards decreases traditional differentiators like card brand and design may become less prominent making it more difficult for card issuers to differentiate case studies order ahead inapp purchases within mobile apps can turn traditional physical purchases into online purchases and combine purchase and payment into a single tap eliminating the step for payment method selection virtual payment processing services store customers payment credentials and allow customers to use those credentials in oneclick or tap to maximise convenience and improve security payments cashless world scenario consolidation of the payment market necessary conditions for the scenario implications of the scenario on availability and widespread adoption of seamless payment solutions to a large number of customers and at a large proportion of everyday spend merchants customers willingness to relinquish control over payment options eg convenience over control customers merchants less complex and timeconsuming customer experience at checkout decreased cognitive effort on payment selection reduced friction and improved efficiency at check out issuers seek to incentivize merchants to influence consumers to load their cards incumbents increased competitive intensity among existing players to become top of wallet marginalisation of niche players overall ecosystem reduction in the number of credit card providers increased stickiness to those surviving card issuing institutions opportunities and risks associated with the scenario opportunities risks development of more personalised rewards program me for cards to attract and retain customers over time potential decrease in the number of available card choices as consumers use fewer cards leading to decreased competition and innovation payments cashless world scenario fragmentation of the payment market today future customers customers bank account bank account cards cards payment solutions payment solutions merchants merchants narrative summary of impact the adoption of digital wallets will free consumers from physical limitations on the number of cards they can carry allowing niche cards to gain popularity particularly in geographies where customers are value conscious this proliferation of cards will encourage the development of decision support systems that interact with digital wallets to help customers choose the best card for each purchase as a result owning and using multiple payment cards will no longer hinder the delivery of a seamless customer experience prompting further proliferation of niche merchantissued cards the successful deployment of digital wallets eliminates the need to carry physical cards and virtually removes the limitations on the number of payment cards customers can carry and use proliferation of digital wallets also enables decision support systems to help customers optimise card usage by automating card selection based on loyalty points and other benefits this drives a proliferation of niche and merchantbranded cards optimised for specific purchases splintering share of wallet across many providers case studies currently customers can add multiple payments cards credit and debit to leading digital wallets eg for apple pay unlimited for google wallet and pick and choose a payment card for each transaction with few additional clicks taps while currently not integrated with digital wallets decision support systems run on mobile and wearable devices to automatically recommend the optimal payment option among payment cards added by the customers to maximise the overall rewards payments cashless world scenario fragmentation of the payment market necessary conditions for the scenario implications of the scenario on merchants widespread acceptance of smart payment solutions or the solutions successful integration with existing acceptance markets development of payment solutions into platforms surrounded by innovative ecosystems eg increased linkage between mobile wallets and merchant apps locationbased checkout experience creation proven efficiency and impartiality of recommendations engines card choice for each transactions creation of streamlined user experience and differentiated value propositions by smart wallets that will drive consumers to want to adopt the optimisation services merchants incumbents customers able to optimise reward collection without sacrificing seamless experience potential increase in debt as it becomes easier to issue multiple credit cards offset by spending management functionalities of mobile wallets potential decrease in total merchant service charges paid as privatelabel cards are more widely adopted among each merchants customer base

of impact today merchants and payment solutions providers such as mobile wallets pay higher merchant service charges on credit cardfunded transactions than on bank accountfunded transactions to reduce costs these players will use incentives to encourage customers to switch their funding method from credit cards to bank accounts at the same time merchants will adopt datadriven alternative vendor financing solutions that offer customers lower interest rates and provide financing income to merchants these innovations will place pressure on credit card transaction volume and interest income limiting issuers ability to offer attractive loyalty programmes and reducing competitiveness in the face of merchants who are able to directly offer their own incentives eg loyalty points special

lower fees on bank account transactions disrupt the current credit card loyalty models how will financial institutions assess their customers creditworthiness without traditional payment history what will the future loyalty models look like on direct payments from bank accounts implications remaining questions payments how will the evolution of decentralised or nontraditional payment schemes change the role of traditional financial institutions payments decentralised and nontraditional payment schemes executive summary context innovation the current value transfer system built on automated clearing houses and intermediary banks has made it easier for customers to send money across geographies but many pain points remain to enabling rapid and inexpensive value transfer between countries decentralised currencies and mobile money solutions provide compelling alternatives to traditional value transferring systems by streamlining the intermediating processes future of payment and settlement rails driven by competitive pressure from these innovations the future of value transfer will be more global faster more transparent and cheaper these nontraditional schemes may compete directly with the existing financial ecosystem as alternative payment networks emerge along with a variety of financial products denominated in networks native currency financial institutions may choose to facilitate the growth of alternative payment networks as a complement to existing networks they might act as a gateway for value into these networks and launch financial products that are connected to nontraditional payment schemes alternatively the nontraditional schemes may act as a catalyst for traditional institutions to develop solutions that fix key pain points in the current value transfer system potentially by leveraging elements of the nontraditional schemes key implications to bring innovations to the traditional value transfer rails financial institutions must collaborate to identify top priority areas for transformation solve for regulatory complexity payments decentralised and nontraditional payment schemes while the rails built on automated clearing houses have enabled value transfer across geographies many pain points are emerging as customer expectations rise how do financial institutions facilitate value transfer today while the current rails for value transfer between financial institutions are complex and involve many institutions a similar process is used for all transactions from large institutional transfers to the settlement of retail payments sender request sender asks their financial institution to transfer an amount to a specific address using bic or iban codes secure messaging sending bank sends a secure message to the recipient bank requesting transfer of the specified amount flow of funds the recipient bank responds to the sender banks request for funds via a clearing house or correspondent bank flow of funds transfer request authorisation sender sender bank broker fx market intrabank interbank secure messaging automated clearing house intermediary bank recipient bank recipient evolution of money transfer schemes key pain points with todays schemes the basic elements of the current value transfer process have been in place for over years the concept of wire transfers was originated by telegraph companies eg western union who would receive funds for transfer from a sending party and send a telegraph to correspondent branch instructing them to deliver the money to the intended recipient the digitisation of this process throughout the latter half of the th century improved the security of messaging services and improved the settlement time of clearing house activities the actual transfer is not instantaneous funds may take several hours or even days to move from the senders account to the receivers account if the sending and recipient banks do not hold reciprocal accounts the payment must be sent to a clearing house or correspondent bank for the assurance of payment for the recipient adding costs and delays the complex structure of requesting the recipient bank to demand payment makes the process more vulnerable to fraud using exposed sender credentials payments decentralised and nontraditional payment schemes decentralised payment schemes leverage cryptographic protocols to transfer value virtually in a secure low cost nearinstantaneous manner what are decentralised payment schemes decentralised networks utilise a common set of protocols to allocate tasks across many individual nodes rather than via a central point email is an example of a decentralised system that uses a common protocol smtp to distribute mail between a vast number of servers illustrative distributed payment network decentralised payment systems allow users to transmit value between users typically secured by a set of cryptographic processes sender most decentralised payment schemes use a single distributed ledger and denominate payments between users in a native currency often referred to as a cryptocurrency recipient decentralised system ledger how have decentralised schemes developed what are some emerging decentralised schemes digital payment schemes are as old as the internet itself with many notable failures including beenz flooz and digicash and the most notable success being paypal however all of these schemes utilised a centralised network requiring trust by users in a central counterparty in a pseudonymous whitepaper proposed the creation of a distributed ledger where transactions between participants could be processed in a trustless environment via a cryptographic process the implementation of this distributed payment protocol is the bitcoin network and the native currency of the ledger are bitcoins since a range of service providers have emerged to support the acceptance of payments via the bitcoin network at the same time many competing schemes have launched built on the same underlying concepts but employing different encryption technology or focusing on different use cases digital currency run on decentralised payment network opensource lowcost th of a cent payments protocol and instant exchange of any form of money or value opensource pp internet currency enabling instant near zero cost payments decentralised open source information registration and transfer system characteristics of decentralised schemes secured by cryptographic protocols capable of near realtime settlement very low transaction costs frequently open source where changes are governed by a network of participants transparency and traceability of transactions is typically superior to current systems but user identification may be weaker or nonexistent payments decentralised and nontraditional payment schemes mobile monies and pp value transfer networks rely on a trusted central party to transfer value rapidly across geographies even in underbanked regions what are nontraditional payment schemes mobile money refers to a network that supports payment from one user to another via a mobile device a mobile money service may be launched by any firm not just a traditional financial institution mobile money services have been launched by network operators mpesa and online retailers paypal transactions may be denominated in a fiat currency or in a form of value issued by the central intermediary in developing countries mobile payment solutions have been deployed to extend financial services to the unbanked or underbanked how have nontraditional schemes developed in researchers noted that individuals in uganda botswana and ghana were spontaneously using airtime as a proxy for money transfer transferring airtime to their relatives or friends who would then use or resell it sender mobile money eg a telco recipient sender pp transfer recipient local account local account batch net flow of funds transfer request authorisation what are some emerging nontraditional schemes in april kenyas dominant mobile network operator safaricom launched a new mobile phonebased payment and money transfer service mpesa allowing users to deposit money into an account that can be accessed on their cell phones and send balances using sms in january transferwise launched a pp crossborder money transfer service to aggregate and facilitate exchange of foreign currency and transfer needs at the interbank rate characteristics of nontraditional schemes transactions are completed rapidly and are highly transparent to both senders and recipients transfer costs are very low and fees are highly transparent many schemes are moving towards open systems as they build in interoperability with other schemes and traditional outlets eg atm does not necessarily require a traditional bank account or well established financial infrastructure making them well suited for financial inclusion goals payments decentralised and nontraditional payment schemes while nontraditional payment schemes offer a greater level of efficiency than the traditional rails their usefulness is dependent on the scale of adoption how do decentralised and nontraditional schemes differ from traditional money transfer models traditional model decentralised schemes other nontraditional schemes value chain key characteristics advantages shortcomings processing of transfers is handled by correspondent financial institutions often facilitated by payment schemes eg swift visa mastercard relies on a central clearing body transfer is initiated by recipient bank network is scalable and includes most existing financial institutions proven ability to manage large capital flows on a global scale large retail and institutional customer base who are familiar with the model limited visibility into value flow for both senders and recipients prone to fraud when the senders credentials are exposed transfer can take days and efficiency varies by countries institutions high costs number of intermediaries value transfer is recorded in a distributed ledger transactions are managed by a distributed network of processors sender initiates the transfer transfer history is transparent traceable and practically unalterable lower direct costs of transaction due to distribution across the network lower exposure to conventional fraud settlement is near realtime no counterparty risk value transfer is facilitated by a single trusted nonfinancial rd party relies on the intermediary to keep records and settle the transfer sender initiates the transfer simpler and cheaper transfers improved user transparency enables rapid or realtime settlement the reach of the intermediary may exceed that of financial institutions particularly in developing countries high volatility in the value of the native currency regulatory scrutiny creates challenges to connecting with fiat currency ecosystems scalability is dependent on the availability adoption of the intermediary platform cross border flows of funds can create regulatory challenges anonymity of accounts irreversibility of transfers creates security issues higher exposure to unconventional fraud eg largescale hacking payments decentralised and nontraditional payment schemes these emerging nontraditional payment schemes will create competitive pressure for the value transfer rails to become faster cheaper and more borderless key characteristics of the future value transfer systems global geographical distance as a factor in transferring value will continue to narrow and even underbanked regions will be connected fast transparent the time it takes to transfer value between two accounts will be significantly reduced the flow of funds will become increasingly visible and traceable secure the opportunities for fraudulent activities will be largely reduced reduced costs the cost to execute transfers will be minimised with the streamlined and automated rails in achieving these

narrative summary of impact increasingly perceiving alternative payment schemes as a threat traditional financial institutions have intensified efforts to transform their payment and settlement rails financial institutions may make major upgrades to existing payment and settlement systems or build on top of them employing existing or proprietary message sets alternatively financial institutions may leverage innovations developed by alterative payment networks such as the block chain to achieve these goals but elect to stop short of using the alternative networks themselves as transferring value within the existing financial ecosystem becomes cheaper faster more transparent and more global the incentives for customers to use payment rails from nontraditional providers will decrease in the face of uncertainties associated with these options alternative payment schemes act as a catalyst for traditional institutions to develop new solutions leveraging elements of alternative schemes traditional institutions build more streamlined rail for the movement of money these solutions reduce the advantages of alternative payment schemes and retain the flow of money within the traditional financial network as a result alternative payment schemes do not reach maturity and cease to be a serious threat of disintermediation case studies a number of national retail financial institutions

insurance how will disaggregating forces across the value chain transform the insurance industry insurance disaggregation of value chain executive summary context innovation a number of emerging forces are creating pressure across the insurance value chain with the potential to redefine the structure of the market the rise of online aggregators and the potential entry of technology players could disaggregate the distribution of personal and small commercial policies and separate insurers from the ownership of customer relationships the development of autonomous vehicles and advanced sensors will inherently reduce risk with home and auto while the proliferation of sharing economies will homogenize risks these and other forces are standardising and commoditising individual risks future of insurance value chain new sources of capital and investment management capabilities such as hedge funds and investment banks are aggressively moving in to the insurance industry through innovative securitisation products offering more costeffective options to fund policies as the insurance value chain is disaggregated and commoditised the importance of scale as a source of efficiency may increase leading to market consolidation increased use of commoditised personal insurance products in cross sell along with blurring lines of property ownership may support the rise of extremely broad multiline policies disaggregation of the mass personal lines market may also lead to insurers shifting their focus to niche and commercial markets where traditional capabilities like actuarial skill underwriting and personal relationships can make bigger differences to performance key implications in order to remain competitive in the face of a disaggregating value chain insurers will need to reconsider which core competencies they will invest in to maintain a strong competitive position insurance disaggregation of value chain the industry has been slowly evolving over the past couple decades adopting customer centric innovations from other financial services functions what are the core capabilities of insurers today insurance is typically considered one of the functions within financial services where the adoption of innovation has been the slowest however over the past decade many innovative practices such as digital channels and process automation have been gradually adopted by many insurers this has been especially true in personal lines of business while large commercial lines have continued to focus on establishing a personal touch across the value chain traditional broker agent inperson distribution faces significant competitive pressures from digital channels in personal lines distribution partnerships with banks and retailers through whitelabelling

existing retail channels eg agent force brand as properties home and auto become safer and sharing economy homogenises risks individual risks will be increasingly standardised and commoditised the importance of actuarial and underwriting capabilities will grow as other parts of the value chain are disaggregated insurers margins on personal and small commercial products will decrease a larger

frequently cross sell commoditised low margin products with their higher margin peers eg the bundling of low margin auto insurance with higher margin home insurance as the commoditisation of risks accelerates across various products multiline insurers may focus more heavily on bundling and cross selling products to achieve economies of scale and build customer loyalty leveraging the more granular and individualised data available through connected devices insurers may ultimately be able to take product cross selling to its logical extreme offering a single insurance policy covering all or a very wide range of an individuals risks personal insurance products that are commoditised in the future will be increasingly used as a bundle to cross sell other more profitable products as the concept of property ownership blurs in the sharing economy the concept of cross sell may expand so that an insurance policy encompasses all risks associated with the customer rather than risks associated with specific assets through increased connectivity the personal insurance policies may be adjusted more frequently to add subtract or modify coverages to match the customers individual usage patterns case studies farm family has introduced the concept of aggregate flexible contract to small medium enterprises concentrating on rural and suburban area and targeting specific risks surrounding certain sectors eg special farm package for agriculture owners on the personal insurance side many multiline insurers offer bundling discounts to customers to promote cross sell across

insurance increasing levels of connectivity telematics offers a promising proposition to pc and health insurers and customers but its adoption is slow due to a number of factors what is telematics first introduced in the mids telematics insurance products leverage the gps technology and wireless communications to enable auto insurers to collect usage and behaviour data of their customers in real time or nearreal time leveraging such data insurers charge customers premiums based on their usage of the vehicles and current driving behaviours instead of typical fixed premiums given the strong correlation between usage of vehicles and risks todays telematics devices have evolved to measure a variety of additional behavioural factors from rapid acceleration to air bag deployment exploration submission rd party data underwriting quoting binding claims servicing near realtime behaviourbased pricing renewal benefits of telematics factors inhibiting adoption of telematics pricing accuracy insurers risk models become more accurate as individual empirical and near realtime data is used combined with historical predictions based on segmentation lower claims telematics products incentivise safer behaviours among customers as premiums are linked directly to the behaviours and reduce the overall claims losses for insurers personalisation as usage and behavioural data accumulates the insurance premium becomes increasingly personalised to each customer resulting in lower premiums for customers and customer stickiness for insurers device selection installation of physical tracking devices creates an additional moment of truth when customers may abandon adoption of telematics only predominantly lowrisk customers sign up for telematicsbased insurance contracts and highrisk customers opt out deterring insurers economics delays gathering and utilisation of data is usually delayed due to connectivity costs and analytical power incentives discounts often do not

executive summary context innovation following the financial crisis lower risk appetites among retail banks have significantly limited access to traditional bank intermediated lending this is particularly true among subprime borrowers over the same period of time alternative lending platforms leveraging pp models have experienced rapid growth these platforms use alternative adjudication methods and lean automated processes to offer loans to a broader base of customers and a new class of investment opportunities to savers future of savings lending as competitive pressures from alternative lending platforms grow the overall savings and lending industry will be forced to compete alternative lenders could successfully move upstream to replace traditional institutions in intermediating prime loans while traditional lenders restricted by legacy processes and high capital requirements lose share alternatively traditional institutions and alternative platforms may continue to cater to different classes of investors and borrowers especially with growing partnerships between smaller traditional institutions and alternative platforms traditional institutions could also transform their processes and technologies potentially absorbing alternative platforms to adopt the key features of alternative lending business models key implications emerging alternative lending models create both competitive threats and evolutionary opportunities for financial institutions making it important for incumbent institutions and alternative platforms to develop more integrated partnerships and learn from and share each others capabilities deposits lending alternative models of lending in a riskaverse economy retail banks model of intermediating savers and borrowers has reduced accessibility to loans for subprime customers how do financial institutions facilitate lending activities today retail banks receive savings from their account holders and provide interest on the savings in return in most countries regulators mandate banks to insure and hold minimum reserve on the savings held using the saved funds retail banks originate loans to borrowers and receive interest in return the availability of loans and the interest rates are determined by the adjudication of borrowers risk profiles typically using credit scores risk averse typically interest received on loans are higher than interest paid on savings to account for default risks and other operational costs the breadth of borrowers served is dependent on each banks risk appetite which is generally related to the size and scale of the banks eg riskier borrowers tend to be served by tier banks or balance sheet lenders risk seeking savers borrowers retail banks not served by traditional retail banks low risk high risk evolution of traditional lending models following the global financial crisis customer trust surrounding financial services quickly dissipated regulators also mandated increased safety measures around loans eg higher capital requirements which resulted in many banks tightening loan requirements this mutual loss of confidence created a lending gap leaving a considerable portion of borrowing needs underserved by financial institutions furthermore customer preferences in financial services are rapidly changing demanding more transparency efficiency and control over their savings and loans key characteristics of traditional models limited access slow speed a growing lending gap limits the availability of loans to individuals and companies with higher risk profiles traditional adjudication processes with multiple layers of approval limits the banks ability to process loans in timely manner margin for error traditional adjudication models and credit scores tend to miss suitable lending opportunities in a virtual economy limited control borrowers have limited visibility and control over the uses of funds

savers and borrowers by acting as online marketplaces pp lenders facing lower funding costs than traditional depository lenders alternative adjudication alternative lending platforms assess the creditworthiness of borrowers based on metrics beyond the credit scores used by traditional lenders eg social data lean automated processes alternative lending platforms are free of legacy processes and technologies allowing them to onboard and assess borrowers and lenders in a more streamlined fashion most alternative lenders also refine their risk engine more frequently than traditional lenders to incorporate feedback based on empirical analysis at most alternative platforms assessment of borrowers is at least partly automated against predefined rules for fast transparent processing deposits lending alternative models of lending traditional and alternative lending models differ significantly in their flexibility and allocation of risk traditional lending intermediaries eg retail banks take risks themselves and leverage their scale to provide stability to lenders depositors however their focus is typically limited to lowrisk borrowers and they charge high fees in form of interest spread therefore the needs of riskseeking savers and highrisk borrowers are not fully served by traditional banks alternative lending platforms typically provide an online marketplace where lenders have the flexibility to pick and choose a desired risk portfolio the marketplace generates lenders scores and typically takes a cut of loan originations and ongoing loan revenues but does not directly take risks alternative lending platforms savers borrowers alternative platforms risk averse risk seeking low risk high risk traditional lending intermediaries borrowers savers risk averse low risk retail banks risk seeking high risk traditional intermediaries hold savings from retail commercial and institutional clients and provide interest in return using those funds traditional intermediaries originate loans to borrowers based on their creditworthiness and earn interest the differential between interest or spread is the intermediarys return lenders savings are protected by the intermediaries reserves and by deposit insurance schemes the complete pooling of savings and loans most effectively mitigates individual default risks ecosystem description advantages limitations alternative lending platforms directly match lending needs of borrowers with willing lenders individuals or institutions contractual obligations exist directly between borrowers and lenders and platforms provide mere intermediation and adjudication alternative platforms are compensated through originations fees or a percentage of interest payments lending processes and risk profiles are transparent to both borrowers and lenders traditionally underserved borrowers gain access to loans and diverse risk appetite of lenders is met reduction of transaction costs lenders do not have flexibility to determine the desired level of risk and return primary focus on low risk loans exclude higher risk borrowers depending on the market conditions investments may be more susceptible to

underwriting increased access control and transparency adverse selection by lending intermediaries with superior underwriting capabilities will lead to a broader adoption of alternative credit indicators for adjudication and pricing use of alternative adjudication and diversification of lenders will provide more lending options to a broader spectrum of borrowers eg thin file borrowers lenders will gain more control over the return on their savings based on their risk appetite and more visibility into the flow of their savings reduced costs for borrowers increased return for savers

executive summary context innovation traditionally capital raising activities have been facilitated by specialised financial institutions leveraging their deep expertise to identify and support investment opportunities access to investments in these intermediaries has been limited to select high net worth and institutional investors in the face of growing interest in startups and digital democratisation a series of alternative funding platforms have emerged widening access to capital raising activities and providing funding to a greater number of companies and projects future of alternative funding platforms while these alternative funding platforms are not likely to replace the traditional capital raising ecosystem in the short or medium term their growth could change the role of incumbent institutions alternative funding platforms may solidify their position as a key capital raising intermediary for higher risk seedstage companies which would increase their access to funding and increase the number of new firms eligible for venture capital alternative platforms could also evolve to focus on investors with motives beyond financial return they could help funnel capital to lowreturn opportunities that would not have qualified for investment from traditional venture capitalists but provide nonfinancial returns to crowd investors eg alternative energy projects or local development projects alternative capital raising platforms could also provide a channel for larger companies to raise capital directly from their customers base potentially reducing costs while supporting customer engagement key implications the opportunities created by the proliferation of alternative capital raising platforms likely outweigh the risks they pose to incumbent institutions as they enable a more diversified pipeline of investment opportunities to support a richer innovation ecosystem capital raising alternative funding platforms capital raising has been traditionally facilitated by specialised institutions with deep expertise but individual investors have limited access so far how do financial institutions facilitate capital raising activities today while smaller loans for small medium enterprises are directly issued by retail commercial banks larger capital needs of companies are typically fulfilled by issuing equity or debt through a specialised intermediary like an investment bank unlike lending transactions where loans are issued from the banks balance sheet investment banks facilitate the structuring marketing and sales of equity or debt capital to potential investors and charge a fee to the issuing company in certain cases banks participate as an investor by buying shares bonds managing investors funds or providing a

intermediaries may have limited overlap in investment opportunities traditional intermediaries will need to compete for investments especially from angel investors against distributed platforms where investors can play more active roles shortening capital raising cycles with access to more diverse funding options new companies will be able to grow at a quicker pace and the average time between funding stages will be shortened alternatives to wealth products as individual customers gain access to investment products with potential higher returns and or better aligned to their interests their mix of investments in traditional wealth management products will shift over time how will traditional institutions from investment managers to investment banks participate in distributed capital raising platforms to maximise the benefits from the broadened capital raising market eg direct entry sourcing partnerships investment vehicles valuation model scenario incubator of seedstage companies scenario provider of funding to lower return investments scenario evolution into an alternative funding option for larger companies changes to sourcing strategy advantages of distributed platforms as a sourcing tool such as testing with future customer base will create pressure to traditional internallydriven sourcing models how will traditional intermediaries discover unique investment opportunities and generate exclusivity when most investment opportunities become visible to competition via distributed platforms channel for new investment opportunities distributed platforms may enable traditional institutions to directly participate in smaller investments without significant efforts eg entry of hedge funds what are the hurdles that prevent traditional institutions from participating in smaller investments and how may distributed platforms resolve them importance of selection traditional intermediaries ability to provide value not linked directly to financing will become more important if they wish to maintain their current role what differentiated value will traditional intermediaries offer to compete against distributed platforms that successfully move upstream implications remaining questions investment management how will the empowerment of individuals through automated systems and social networks transform the business of investment management investment management empowerment of individuals executive summary context innovation the wealth management industry has suffered from the loss of customer trust since the financial crisis this trust has been slow to recover in the face of continued economic uncertainties in this environment a number of disruptors from automated wealth management services to social trading platforms have emerged to provide low cost sophisticated alternatives to traditional wealth managers these solutions cater to a broader customer base and empower customers to have more control of their wealth management future of investment management these innovations will create pressures for the wealth management industry to improve the value delivered while broadening access to more customers cheaper and faster online tools and automated services that originally catered to underserved customers may steal share from traditional wealth managers in the mass affluent market pushing traditional managers to switch their focus to more personalised relationshipbased segments alternatively automated investment management platforms could commoditise traditional highvalue services and reduce the value delivered by wealth managers across all customer segments enabling traditional wealth managers to focus on providing more personalised bespoke services to a broader customer base empowered with intuitive and affordable tools some individual investors may also gain sufficient level of sophistication to act as investment experts selling and sharing their investment expertise via social trading platforms that erode the value of traditional wealth management professionals key implications the emergence and growing popularity of automated wealth management services and customer empowerment tools will pose a tangible threat to the traditional practices of the wealth management industry however incumbent institutions who can embrace these innovations and streamline their processes will be able to

management empowerment of individuals what does this mean for financial institutions key implications and remaining questions safe bets likely implications under all scenarios decoupling of advisory and products as more customers switch to automated advisors for more streamlined and costeffective advisory services the onestop model of distributing financial institutions wealth products primarily via their advisory channels will become less effective eroding advantages of scale traditional wealth managers scalebased advantages will erode as once manual processes are automated virtual channels are utilised and core infrastructure become available at a low cost to new entrants increased competition the commoditising forces generated by new entrants will make more segments and services less profitable for traditional wealth managers and intensify competition among traditional players in more specialised segments or services how will wealth managers that used to distribute their own

source of competition importance of brand and trust in competing against prosumers who can generate similar return on investment traditional institutions brand and customer trust will become a critical differentiator how will traditional investment managers change their competitive and workforce strategy as emerging platforms empower sophisticated individuals to compete directly with professional investors investment management how will the externalisation of key processes transform the financial ecosystem investment management process externalisation executive summary context innovation many processes within investment institutions are considered as core to their business operation however a new breed of process externalisation providers are using highly flexible platforms typically based in the cloud to provide financial institutions with increased efficiency and new levels of process sophistication excellence future of process externalisation as service providers externalise and consolidate processes previously considered core capabilities the core competencies that differentiate winning financial institutions shift from process execution to more human factors eg synthesis decision making external service providers could enable small and mediumsized organisations to better compete with large incumbents by providing them access to toptier processes that were once unreachable due to lack of scale some external providers that consolidate regulatory compliance capabilities may also create an opportunity to centralise communications to regulatory agencies this would improve the speed at which financial institutions are able to respond to regulatory changes and ensure a higher level of compliance key implications by exploring options to externalise a large number of redundant processes across institutions firms will benefit from efficiency gains and increased sophistication however financial institutions must consider which capabilities they should continue to focus on as a source of competitive advantage investment management process externalisation many processes within investment management institutions considered as core to their business today are facing various pressures core capabilities of investment institutions today over the past few decades externalisation of noncore processes eg hr finance has been a major trend in the financial services industry to drive efficiency and operational excellence despite this trend many processes such as transaction monitoring regulatory compliance and risk management continue to be perceived as mission critical or competitive differentiators and have remained in house data collection analysis trade strategy execution transaction monitoring risk management compliance hr finance core processes largely remaining inhouse nonecore processes typically externalised evolution of landscape impacting core processes key challenges faced by institutions the notion of core internal processes can change when external providers emerge with the ability to complete the process more efficiently and with more sophistication than individual institutions the ability to access and collect market data was once considered a critical internal competency for equity investments firms until external providers emerged to provide more standardised and comprehensive set of data eg bloomberg thomson reuters a number of issues are arising that impact the institutions ability to excel across todays core processes increased regulatory burden as a result of the financial crisis eg the doddfrank act and the introduction of stricter compliance requirements eg antimoney laundering has taken up a large amount of institutions capacity legacy processes and systems built based on the physical computing environment continue to limit institutions flexibility and agility in adapting to the rapidly changing market conditions and continuously evolving regulatory requirements capacity constraints lost capacity on updates and maintenance limits the ability to invest in core capabilities high cost of maintenance updating and maintaining processes and technologies are costly and timeconsuming limited flexibility agility inconsistency timely update of the processes and technologies is limited due to costs and efforts required fragmented local legacy processes and technologies impede connectivity across the organisation scaledriven barriers complexity sophistication of capabilities is not feasible due to the institutions scale and size inflexible systems designed for past market environments result in added complexity to adapt to the current environment investment management process externalisation the new breed of process externalisation providers are built on the technologies and philosophies behind web key innovations enabling the new breed of process externalisation advanced analytics cloud computing natural language utilise advanced computing power algorithms and analytical models to not only automate existing manual processes but also provide a new level of sophistication leverage cloud technology to improve connectivity with and within institutions to facilitate data sharing streamline implementation and maintenance of processes and enable realtime processing integrate natural language technology into processes to make them more intuitive for end users reducing the need for deep technical backgrounds common models of the new breed of process externalisation providers platform asaservice capability sharing technology platforms such as realtime databases and expert systems that leverage automation to help users complete tasks faster and with fewer resources provide full externalisation of an entire capability including automated and manual processes as a service to institutions to minimise infrastructure investments required facilitate institutions to work with one another to share capabilities or easily integrate with new providers by constructing legal and technical standards and vehicles investment management process externalisation for each capability within investment institutions that are considered core process externalisation can effectively resolve key pain points experienced today illustrative transformative potential of process externalisation across core capabilities current state pain points data collection analysis collection from multiple sources required for certain assets processing of disparate formats required reliance on manual modelling leading to human errors lengthy turnaround time and capacity constraints to support more prudent decision making benefits offered by external providers aggregating data collection from multiple sources and automating extraction not only

higher value activities that provide competitive differentiation as this pattern repeats over multiple processes a financial institutions competitive position ceases to be defined by core operational excellence and instead is defined by which higher value activities they have chosen to focus on service providers using advanced technologies provide options for financial institutions to externalise processes once considered core capabilities competitive advantages derived from excellence in process execution will disappear as high quality process execution becomes a commodity available for purchase financial institutions are required to redefine what capabilities differentiate them from other institutions with process execution taking a backseat to more human factors case studies the ability to quickly and accurately model market projections and hypotheses through large quant teams has traditionally been a key advantage of large financial institutions kensho threatens that advantage by offering a next generation analytics platform for the investment industry with massivelyparallel statistical computing scalable analytics architectures and userfriendly visual interfaces by leveraging kenshos platform any investment institution can now rapidly model projections without an army of quantitative analysts instead focusing more human capabilities like hypothesis generation

average level of sophistication of processes across institutions opportunities and risks associated with the scenario opportunities risks fewer process failures as they are externalised to more focused and specialised providers emergence of institutions competing to excel in specific processes drives deeper specialisation increased capacity for financial institutions to be innovative due to reduced focus on resource intensive core processes centralisation of processes creates larger implications of process failures including continuity risks for banking in the case of a failure of an external service provider risks resulting from potential lack of clarity surrounding accountabilities loss of deep process knowledge within financial institutions may have unforeseen spillover consequences in other areas of the business investment management process externalisation scenario level playing field for newer smaller financial institutions today future large institutions have access to sophisticated processes small institutions have limited ability to build sophisticated processes both small and large institutions gain access to sophisticated processes via focused external providers vs narrative once an external service provider has developed the tools for a financial institution to externalise a process the cost of extending that service to additional financial institutions is typically very low and not dependent on the institutions size small and mediumsized financial institutions capitalise on these economics to both improve their efficiency and radically increase the sophistication of their processes across the board as process sophistication ceases to be a source of competitive advantage for large financial institutions small and mediumsized institutions are able to increase their focus on differentiating capabilities summary of impact external service providers provide small and mediumsized organisations access to sophisticated capabilities which were previously unattainable due to lack of scale barriers to entry into the market will be lowered and the playing field will be leveled with small and mediumsized organisations

size of institutions decreases investment management process externalisation scenario centralised communications with regulatory agencies today future risk monitor compliance risk monitor compliance narrative summary of impact a number of niche service providers are emerging who are able to externalise processes related to specific regulations eg restricted holdings kyc these firms are able to interpret regulatory changes and translate them into rules that can be applied across various financial institutions improving regulatory compliance and the speed at which financial institutions can respond to regulatory changes as regulatory compliance within financial institutions becomes more closely integrated with these service providers some regulators may choose to collaborate directly with them even to the point of issuing regulations in code rather than as policy documents more regulatory compliance and monitoring processes are outsourced to a small number of service providers with better connections to and understanding of regulations reducing the compliance burden for financial institutions these compliance service providers can act as centralised communication touch point for regulators by solidifying their connections with regulators these providers improve the speed at which financial institutions are able to respond to regulatory changes ensuring a higher level of compliance case studies fundapps organises regulatory information and delivers a cloudbased managedservice to automate shareholding disclosure and monitor investment restrictions across regulatory regimes on a daily basis fundapps partners with a global legal service provider to monitor and translate changes in relevant regulations into rules on a daily basis if regulatory agencies partner with fundapps in the future they could ensure consistent compliance across financial institutions make dissemination of regulatory changes in disclosure regimes faster and reduce the compliance burden faced by the industry investment management process externalisation scenario centralised communications with regulatory agencies necessary conditions for the scenario implications of the scenario on buyin from multiple regulators to collaborate with external service providers regarding regulatory topics will be necessary dealing with emerging risks like cyber security might be a good starting point solid track record of performance and reliability demonstrated by externalisation business models full accountability and liability for actions remain with financial institutions

risks associated with the scenario opportunities risks opportunities to improve the clarity of regulations across jurisdictions cost for compliance and regulation which tends to be very high in global institutions potentially will be reduced standardised data simplifies supervision for regulators unclear how risks of regulatory capture will be influenced by externalised compliance models amplification of noncompliant activities and unclear liabilities when centralised externalisation providers fail decreased internal compliance expertise within financial institutions may have unintended consequences investment management process externalisation what does this mean for financial institutions key implications and remaining questions safe bets likely implications under all scenarios loss of negotiating power and continuity as more capabilities technologies and processes are externalised financial institutions will become increasingly dependent on rd parties for continuity skill loss of workforce even though externalising less valuable capabilities will create efficiency it may result in workforce skill loss over the long term and employees ability to develop a holistic view of financial services operations how will financial institutions participate in capability sharing with other institutions to balance efficiency with control eg utility creation co

organisation will be critical to adapt to the changing landscape and realign core competencies what capabilities and processes will financial institutions focus investments on to create competitive advantages that cannot be replicated through the new process externalisation providers higher turnover of new entrants externalisation of processes will make it easier for new players to enter the market without significant infrastructure increasing the turnover in the industry imperative for direct participation in order to sustain scaledriven advantages large financial institutions will actively participate in creating funding and acquiring innovative externalisation providers what are the advantages that larger financial institutions may continue to benefit from when externalisation

readable news due to the vast amount of data available most algorithmic traders will focus on different events and triggers unlike most high frequency trading strategies the market reaction to reallife events is not certain and traders with different views skills and analytical tools will make different decisions in face of the same data as the result the trading strategies and tactics of algorithmic traders will vastly diversify the focus of a race for speed moves from chasing price movements to responding to reallife events through big data analysis and machine accessible news market makers trading strategies become diversified as they access different data sources and infer different market outcomes diversification leads to increase in intraday volatility and wider askbid spread case studies new innovative services like dataminr and sntmnt enable traders to gain access to events and news that may trigger market movement eg breaking news ma speculation faster than the competition by utilising nontraditional data sources like social media market sentiment and realtime analytics leveraging these platforms algorithmic traders can leverage their infrastructure to shift focus from reacting to stock price movements to monitoring and reacting to reallife events faster than other traders and investors in the market market provisioning smarter faster machines scenario convergence of trading strategies and activities data sources self learning machines market analyses various data and predicts market outlook in similar ways takes a similar action on any stock narrative summary of impact as access to a universe of realtime data feeds becomes essential to the execution of successful algorithmic trading strategies the set of data used by traders converges with every trader using almost every available data source at the same time algorithms become smarter incorporating machine learning and improving the accuracy of projections with algorithmic traders connected to similar data sources and smarter machines generating similar projections from those data the variances among algorithmic traders activities will decrease accuracy of market projections by trading algorithms gradually improves as market makers gain access to broader sets of big data and more sophisticated machines since each market makers system accurately predicts the market movement differences among various market makers projections and trading strategies are eliminated as trading strategies converge volume decreases and arbitrage opportunities effectively disappear case studies ayasdi leverages topological data analysis to process big data sets to unveil patterns within the network of data in capital markets ayasdis technology can be used to understand the relationships between various reallife events and market performance to derive trading hypotheses over time additional historical data and trading outcomes can be added back to the analysed big data to continuously sophisticate and automatically correct the trading hypotheses neuro dimensions tradingsolutions combines technical analysis with artificial intelligence using neural networks and genetic algorithms to learn patterns from historical data and optimise system parameters as these types of systems become more sophisticated algorithmic traders will simultaneously predict the market performance with a greater degree of accuracy and their trading activities will converge market provisioning smarter faster machines scenario reverting to manual processes data sources traders market regulations require access to external data and or trade execution to be intervened manually narrative summary of impact the utilisation of new data sources like machine readable news and advanced computing in trading activities increases the gap in the level of sophistication between professional algorithmic traders and individual retail investors the public may perceive some of these innovations to be an unfair advantage similar to how infrastructures costs associated with high frequency trading have been scrutinised reacting to public sentiment policy makers and regulatory agencies may impose restrictions on what automated data streams and trading machines can and cannot be used for various activities potential misinterpretation of data by smart machines triggering systemic losses might accelerate such movements toward regulation growing public discontent with algorithmic trading leads to regulations on the use of automated data feeds and or smart machines in obtaining information or executing trades at least some parts of marketmaking activities revert to old manual processes tangibly reducing the trade volume and the liquidity of the market as a result the liquidity of the market will decrease as traders cannot react to factbased price arbitrage as quickly they may also increase their spread to mitigate their risks resulting in unfavourable price formation for both buyers and sellers case studies on april a false report of explosions at the white house was posted on the hacked twitter account of associated press with many algorithmic traders systems linked to key twitter feeds algorithmic trades caused a selling spree nearly immediately after the posting as the result billion was wiped out from the sp index within two minutes of the tweets posting while the market quickly recovered three minutes after the correcting announcement many industry experts and regulatory agencies perceive the event as something that would not have been caused by human traders as humans would have secondguessed the validity of the tweet market provisioning smarter faster machines what does this mean for financial institutions key implications and remaining questions safe bets likely implications under all scenarios reduced role of humans as the adoption of smarter and faster machines accelerates the competition for speed in gathering analysing and acting on data the role of humans in trade execution will diminish and intelligent machines will replace largely human activities today such as trading strategy development larger impact of errors even small errors in data integrity trade strategy and trade execution will lead to much larger impact as endtoend trading activities are automated via smarter faster machines with limited human intervention what role will human traders play as endtoend trading activities become automated through smarter faster machines how will financial institutions effectively sort out erroneous data algorithms and execution to avoid resulting in enormous losses while maintaining execution speed scenario diversification of trading strategies and tactics scenario convergence of trading strategies and activities scenario reverting to manual processes competition for data sources competition to discover new data sources and gain exclusivity will intensify as the focus of algorithmic trading shifts from price movements to reallife events increased specialisation traders with a deeper understanding of specific companies sectors and reallife events will gain advantage over firms with broader approaches as trading strategies diversify how will financial institutions gain exclusive or faster access to data without appearing as having an unfair advantage marginalised returns as trading strategies converge through big data and machine learning competition for each trade triggered by reallife events will intensify and marginal returns will diminish competition for speed when most players in the market rely on similar trading strategies the basis for competition will shift again from discovery of new insights to faster execution via infrastructure investments how will each institution differentiate from one another as the convergence of trading strategies via smarter faster machines lower the margin competitive uncertainty capabilities required to be competitive in the market eg faster computation faster access advanced analytics will change drastically and rapidly depending on regulatory changes leading to uncertainty in traders longterm strategies impetus for agility in order to react timely to those competitive uncertainties generated by potential regulations traders organisational agility will become critical amidst the current shift toward replacement of workforce with smarter faster machines implications remaining questions market provisioning what impact will better connected buyers and sellers have on capital markets market provisioning connecting buyers and sellers executive summary context innovation many illiquid financial assets remain highly dependent on intermediating institutions to discover and connect buyers and sellers often based on networks of preexisting relationships with other institutions however following the financial crisis traditional capital market intermediaries risk appetite has been reduced while their capital requirements increased limiting their ability to take positions on financial assets to create liquidity this has resulted in reduced liquidity mainly for non exchange traded assets leveraging automation and standardisation of information flow a number of platforms informationconnection platforms have emerged with an aim to redefine how buyers and sellers are connected in a variety of markets future of market making intermediation as these platforms proliferate the market landscape may change for many financial products and assets new informationconnection platforms will allow demand and supply represented by smaller intermediaries to be more readily and objectively discovered by counterparties levelling the playing field between them and larger institutions alternatively these platforms could be developed for a group of larger institutions to improve connectivity among themselves reducing their need to connect with smaller intermediaries and stabilising the current market framework for existing institutions informationconnection platforms may also choose to extend the connections to individual investors acting as a market for specific assets and products and opening doors for sellers to easily broaden their buyer base to the broader public key implications improving information flow among market participants through new informationconnection platforms will create tangible benefits to the industry by empowering intermediating institutions to optimise their ability to make the best decisions for their clients however it will also require behaviour changes within those institutions market provisioning connecting buyers and sellers overthecounter activities depend on intermediating institutions to discover and connect buyers and sellers how do financial institutions facilitate financial markets liquidity today for a wide range of assets and financial products financial institutions play a role as an intermediary to connect and act on behalf of buyers and sellers for some assets eg public stocks liquid bonds formal markets exist to facilitate the connection between buyers and sellers typically in the form of exchanges for less liquid and less standardised assets and products demand and supply is often dispersed making direct discovery and connection among buyers and sellers highly inefficient for these assets and products financial institutions aggregate demand and supply and build relationships with one another to effectively create a market the so called overthe counter otc market as an intermediary financial institutions sometimes take positions in the assets traded to provide liquidity or offer advisory services to the buyers and sellers they represent buyers intermediaries intermediaries sellers a b c d e f buyer can be connected with seller but not with seller because their intermediaries do not have contact result when is buying from trade is not executed at the optimal price evolution of otc driven activities key limitations of todays model over the years the markets for standardised assets with high transaction volume have greatly improved their efficiency by adopting technologies to improve connectivity among buyers and sellers however otc markets still rely on relationshipbased intermediaries and non standardised processes to connect buyers and sellers since the financial crisis increased capital requirements and reduced risk appetite among intermediary institutions have limited the desirability of acting as a market maker reducing liquidity for many financial assets and products operational inefficiency highly manual discovery process for the counterparties makes transactions time consuming costly and complex limited liquidity not all buyers and sellers at a given moment are discovered by one another limiting liquidity suboptimal pricing no intermediaries regardless of their size have a full view of the demand and supply making the best price discovery difficult limited visibility buyers and sellers have imperfect visibility into the market supply demand and counterparties limiting their ability to exert control over transactions limited access buyers ability to access assets is limited by their intermediaries connections with sellers intermediaries market provisioning connecting buyers and sellers new platforms are emerging to connect intermediaries of buyers and sellers to facilitate the flow of market information and the discovery of counterparties what are the new platforms leveraging technological innovations a number of platforms have emerged to redefine how buyers and sellers are connected for various financial assets and products improving the efficiency of those markets these platforms automate and standardise collection of demand supply data from intermediaries or buyers and sellers to create an aggregated view of the market and facilitate discovery of the most suitable counterparties some platforms provide additional analyses on the data collected to better inform buyers sellers and their intermediaries in choosing their counterparties buyers intermediaries intermediaries sellers a b c platform e f b buyer seller and seller connected through new platform can exchange information result all transactions are likely to be executed at an optimal price examples of platforms improving connection between buyers sellers and intermediaries fixed income funds fund of funds private equity venture capital shares private company shares private company tenders commodities derivative contracts key characteristics of the platforms improving connection between buyers and sellers social standardisation automation these platforms embed the elements of social networks to facilitate the interaction among buyers sellers and intermediaries and improve how buyers and sellers are evaluated these platforms typically standardise what data points are collected and analysed through a set of sophisticated metrics to allow buyers to evaluate sellers more critically these platforms automatically collect and analyse data to help buyers and sellers make more informed decisions and make the discovery process less relationshipdriven market provisioning connecting buyers and sellers these market connection platforms do not replace the traditional marketmaking activities of intermediaries but rather help them broaden their connections how do market connection platforms differ from traditional models of market making value chain buyers intermediaries intermediaries sellers buyers traditional model market informationconnection platforms intermediaries intermediaries sellers a b c d e f platform a b c d e f key characteristics advantages shortcomings information about buyers and sellers eg current inventory demand historical performance is distributed via relationships awareness existing among their intermediaries intermediaries collect analyse and act on the information about the counterparties and the market reduced chance of counterparty failure by transacting through established trusted intermediary relationships reduced exposure to arbitrage attempts as demand and supply is only visible to a small number of intermediaries highly manual relationshipbased discovery and assessment of demand and supply leading to inefficiency potential to overlook the best price available due to the limitation in the scale of each intermediarys network limited visibility of the transaction process to buyers and sellers intermediaries of buyers and sellers in some cases are directly discovered and connected via a central platform information on counterparties and the market is aggregated and analysed by the central platform for all constituents in the market more efficient discovery and assessment of demand and supply in the market leading to more accurate price formation reduced need for financial institutions to take position in assets and products to generate liquidity increased visibility and control over transactions by buyers and sellers need to balance adequate price formation with potential price discovery and arbitrage attempts potential counterparty risks when dealing with intermediaries or buyers sellers without an established relationship or reputation market provisioning connecting buyers and sellers as buyers sellers and intermediaries become better connected via these platforms the overall efficiency of the market will improve key characteristics of the future markets enabled by improved market connections increased liquidity improved price accuracy transparency more intermediaries and buyers and sellers will be connected with one another to enable more accurate assessment of demand and supply in the market leading to improved liquidity in the market as the aggregate demand and supply can be assessed more accurately intermediaries and buyers sellers will be able to determine the best price more accurately without revealing undesired information to the market buyers and sellers will gain more visibility into the transaction process and therefore will be able to exert greater control over the transactions and reduce the opportunities for suboptimal transactions by intermediaries eg agent conflict of interest improved access faster cheaper transactions the ability to buy sell financial assets and products will be less dependent on the scale or the size of the intermediaries network improving access to the market by more buyers sellers and intermediaries as the discovery and assessment of counterparties become more streamlined and automated the efficiency of intermediaries will improve leading to faster turnaround and lower cost to complete transactions for buyers and sellers how will the market landscape change for various financial assets and products as buyers and sellers are better connected in the future market provisioning connecting buyers and sellers how will the market landscape change for various financial assets and products as buyers and sellers are better connected in the future potential impact of buyer seller connection levelling the playing field for newer smaller institutions stabilising market framework for existing institutions opening the doors to individual investors buyers intermediaries sellers buyers intermediaries sellers buyers intermediaries sellers large large small platform large best match large small large large small platform large best match large small large small platform large best match small unlike relationshipdriven market making where larger institutions have an advantage over smaller institutions new platforms will allow demand and supply represented by smaller institutions to be more readily discovered by counterparties these platforms will also provide fact based measures to make counterparty comparison and selection to be more objective enabling smaller institutions with less developed networks of relationships to compete platforms are developed and used by larger institutions to improve connectivity and efficiency among a group of large players as connections among larger intermediaries are strengthened by informationconnection platforms the need for larger institutions to connect with smaller intermediaries to generate liquidity will decrease effectively building barriers of entry for smaller newer institutions as platforms grow they may choose to extend connections to individual investors eg acting as brokerages when sufficient volume from individual investors can be aggregated these platforms can act as a market for specific assets and products and open doors for sellers to easily broaden their buyer base to the broader public the following scenarios illustrate potential outcomes generated by the innovations discussed in this topic particularly in response to the key question above they are not meant to be future predictions these scenarios are illustrations of particular aspects of the potential future and are not meant to represent a complete view of the market and competitive landscape in many cases some or all scenarios could be realised at the same time market provisioning connecting buyers and sellers scenario levelling the playing field for newer smaller institutions buyers intermediaries sellers platform large large small large best match large small narrative summary of impact market information connection platforms open their doors to intermediating institutions of all sizes smaller institutions are particularly incentivised to join such platforms as the platforms significantly expand the intermediaries access to market information and connect them to a universe of potential counterparties as these platforms grow in scale so will the pressure for greater trade transparency and the use of more quantitative metrics for best execution as large intermediaries yield to client pressure to adopt these metrics they will be more likely to interact with smaller intermediaries with whom they may not have previously established working relationships standardised platforms facilitate connections between large and small intermediating institutions to help them find counterparties considerably expanding the number of trading options for smaller intermediaries whose ability to connect with other institutions was previously limited by scale these platforms provide factbased measures to improve the objectivity of counterparty comparison and selection enabling smaller intermediaries to compete based on the interests of their clients and their merits instead of scale and reputation case studies novus is a portfolio intelligence platform that automatically gathers and analyses data on various funds performance to provide visibility and transparency to fundoffunds managers traditionally fundoffunds managers discovered and researched investment opportunities manually by contacting target funds as a result the ability of fundoffunds to source investment opportunities was dependent on their scale reputation and network through novus automated platform nearly all funds operating across the world and their performance are catalogued and analysed based on an automated collection of regulatory reporting data this allows smaller fundoffunds to independently identify lucrative investment opportunities without being limited by their reputation and the size of their networks market provisioning connecting buyers and sellers scenario levelling the playing field for newer smaller institutions necessary conditions for the scenario toplevel and linelevel buyin from large and small institutions for adopting the informationconnection platforms intermediating institutions are comfortable with managing the risks associated with transacting with less familiar less predefined counterparties clients implications of the scenario on higher chance of achieving the best execution of trades customers ability to achieve optimal results is no longer constricted by the size of their intermediaries sources liquidity from the broadest group of counterparties without risking discovery of demand supply incumbents traders are required to adapt to new behaviours need to establish new processes to support the new business model in particular small institutions who might need to improve their transparency and best execution policies overall ecosystem supports diversification of counterparties based on asset specialisation opportunities and risks associated with the scenario opportunities risks incentivise deeper specialisation of intermediaries by creating higher returns to specialization potential increase in systemic resilience as the result of diversification of related parties transparency of counterparty selection is dependent on the transparency of the informationconnection platforms increased counterparty risks when dealing with newer smaller counterparties without standing reputation or relationships market provisioning connecting buyers and sellers scenario stabilising market framework for existing institutions buyers intermediaries sellers large large small platform large best match large small narrative summary of impact as standardised informationconnection platforms gain popularity a group of large intermediaries may explore adopting the techniques behind these platforms to create a streamlined exclusive network among themselves these large institutions may acquire or partner with standardised platforms to set up artificial barriers against smaller and newer institutions as these exclusive networks grow it will become more difficult for smaller institutions to find trading counterparties or compete with the efficiency delivered by those networks as connections among larger intermediaries are strengthened by platforms the need for larger institutions to connect with smaller intermediaries may decrease effectively building barriers of entry for smaller newer institutions smaller companies lack economies of scale to set up their own liquidity network and may lose their customers to the larger institutions market provisioning connecting buyers and sellers scenario stabilising market framework for existing institutions necessary conditions for the scenario regulatory tolerance of exclusive networks eg no collusion or antitrust concerns large institutions participating in exclusive networks do not experience significant loss in liquidity by excluding smaller institutions continued customer confidence in large institutions to fulfill their orders at a reasonably fair price clients implications of the scenario on liquidity may increase relative to the current state but could be less than under an open platform incumbents large institutions retain strategic advantages over smaller institutions overall ecosystem increased concentration of trades among a small number of intermediaries increased difficulty for small intermediaries to compete outside of niche specialties creates barriers of entry for new intermediaries opportunities and risks associated with the scenario opportunities risks opportunities for large institutions to continue to be highly influential in the market landscape shifting transactions from obscure internal execution facilities to more transparent standardised platforms encouraging concentration of transactions among few large institutions public and regulatory agencies may perceive exclusive networks as an unfair colluding activity market provisioning connecting buyers and sellers scenario opening the doors to individual investors buyers intermediaries sellers large small platform large best match small narrative summary of impact under the current market structure individual investors cannot directly participate in markets for many assets because information about supply and demand is disparate and disorganised as the growth of informationconnection platforms improves visibility into these asset classes the platforms may choose to expand their offerings to provide access for qualified individual investors using these platforms individual investors are able to transact directly with one another or can aggregate their demandsupply to interact with institutional investors as engagement with individual investors grows some platforms may choose to evolve to play the role of a broker as platforms grow they choose to extend their connections to individual investors enabling them to bypass traditional intermediaries and transact with one another these informationconnection platforms may help individual investors represent their aggregate demand and supply more effectively to institutional buyers and sellers if sufficient volume can be aggregated from individual investors these platforms can effectively act as a market for specific assets and products and open doors for sellers to broaden their buyer base case studies liquity provides private company directors with a comprehensive suite of shareholder and equity management services and match investors with private company shareholders who want to sell some or all of their equity liquity facilitates complete deals from introduction to transaction completion including escrow and custodial services market provisioning connecting buyers and sellers scenario opening the doors to individual investors necessary conditions for the scenario implications of the scenario on appetite for individual investors with high degree of financial sophistication to directly participate in trades clients ability to make direct connections with trade counterparties development of execution infrastructure to facilitate trades with individual investors who do not possess overthecounter capabilities ability to aggregate sufficient demand and supply volume among individual investors to transact with institutional investors access to new asset classes for individual investors improved transparency and control over the transaction process incumbents erosion of market shares to brokers and groupings of groups of high net worth individuals impetus for intermediaries to strengthen values they provide to clients beyond transaction facilitation overall ecosystem increased liquidity on standardised platforms opportunities and risks associated with the scenario opportunities risks opportunities to separate transactional services from highvalue advisory offerings opportunities to engage new buyers and sellers in the market increasing liquidity and diversifying the needs and opinions of market participants potential for sophisticated individual investors to make errors due to lack of specialised knowledge relative to professional intermediaries increased burden on regulatory agencies as more parties are directly involved in the market market provisioning connecting buyers and sellers what does this mean for financial institutions key implications and remaining questions safe bets likely implications under all scenarios less differentiation among intermediaries as the ability to fulfill the transaction needs of customers become commoditised by market connection platforms financial intermediaries will be less differentiated by their capabilities redistributed negotiating power with both counterparties and their intermediaries gaining improved visibility into market demand and supply negotiating power will be redistributed based on actual demand and supply resulting in more efficient pricing shift to advisory models as the financial intermediaries role in counterparty discovery and negotiation diminishes their ability to build customer relationships based on advice will become more important to their competitiveness how will financial intermediaries differentiate from one another as improved information flow and trading connections reduce the gaps in institutions ability to find counterparties for their customers scenario levelling the playing field for newer smaller institutions scenario stabilising market framework for existing institutions scenario opening the doors to individual investors reduced fee structure as the cost of fulfilling transactions falls the fee structure of intermediation services as well as actual products themselves eg carry on funds may be reduced regardless of client size how will larger financial institutions continue to maintain advantage over smaller players when economies of scale are eroded and smaller players can gain access the same information and counterparties direct investments by established institutions established intermediaries will become more active in investing implementing and acquiring market connection platforms to stablise the current market framework how will established intermediaries gain exclusive access to market connection platforms while avoiding conflictofinterest ie best execution and antitrust issues implications remaining questions reduced value proposition to institutional customers as some institutional customers choose to directly discover and transact with counterparties via market connection platforms their stickiness on other institutional services such as asset management and investment banking may decrease what additional value will financial intermediaries provide high net worth individuals to prevent the erosion of their businesses by direct access to counterparties via

apr world economic forum section key findings world economic forum the world economic forums analysis has yielded six key findings regarding the implications of distributed ledger technology dlt on the future of financial services key findings dlt has great potential to drive simplicity and efficiency through the establishment of new financial services infrastructure and processes dlt is not a panacea instead it should be viewed as one of many technologies that will form the foundation of next generation financial services infrastructure applications of dlt will differ by use case each leveraging the technology in different ways for a diverse range of benefits digital identity is a critical enabler to broaden applications to new verticals digital fiat legal tender along with other emerging capabilities has the ability to amplify benefits the most impactful dlt applications will require deep collaboration between incumbents innovators and regulators adding complexity and delaying implementation new financial services infrastructure built on dlt will redraw processes and call into question orthodoxies that are foundational to todays business models these key findings are explored in depth in the following pages based on the use case deepdives conducted across financial services world economic forum distributed ledger technology has great potential to drive simplicity and efficiency through the establishment of new financial services infrastructure and processes the following six key value drivers for dlt were identified through the indepth examination of nine use cases from across financial services value drivers operational simplification dlt reduces eliminates manual efforts required to perform reconciliation and resolve disputes regulatory efficiency improvement dlt enables realtime monitoring of financial activity between regulators and regulated entities counterparty risk reduction dlt challenges the need to trust counterparties to fulfil obligations as agreements are codified and executed in a shared immutable environment clearing and settlement time reduction dlt disintermediates third parties that support transaction verification validation and accelerates settlement liquidity and capital improvement dlt reduces lockedin capital and provides transparency into sourcing liquidity for assets fraud minimization dlt enables asset provenance and full transaction history to be established within a single source of truth world economic forum distributed ledger technology is not a panacea instead it should be viewed as one of many technologies that will form the foundation of nextgeneration financial services infrastructure over the last years technology innovation has been fundamental to financial services industry transformation today multiple technologies poised to drive the next wave of financial services innovation are converging in maturity s s s s s s emerging technologies future r o t c u d n o c

facilitated the created a new global exchange of data and enabled a medium to interact with clients and spearheaded frictionless payments collect data series of international businesses biometrics cloud computing cognitive computing distributed ledger technology machine learning predictive analytics quantum computing robotics credit cards messaging services eg swift atms electronic trading digital banking dlt is one of many transformative new technologies that will shape future financial services infrastructure and should be seen as part of a toolbox world economic forum applications of distributed ledger technology will differ by use case each leveraging the technology in different ways for a diverse range of benefits examples of dlt value drivers and benefits use case trade finance automated compliance global payments value driver benefits operational simplification enables realtime multiparty tracking and management of letters of credit and enables faster automated settlement regulatory efficiency improvement provides faster and more accurate reporting by automating compliance processes that draw on immutable data sources settlement time reduction enables the near realtime pointtopoint transfer of funds between financial institutions fis removing friction and accelerating settlement asset rehypothecation liquidity and capital improvement provides market participants with an improved line of sight into assets enabling improved risk evaluation and decisionmaking world economic forum digital identity is a critical enabler to broaden applications to new verticals digital fiat legal tender along with other emerging capabilities has the ability to amplify benefits digital identity digital fiat future innovations correct identity information is critical to ensuring financial transactions are accurate and compliant but integrating physical identity protocols with dlt creates frictions and increases the potential for errors dlt systems are frequently denominated with tokens that are native to the system but users of formal financial infrastructure will demand high levels of liquidity between assets on the system and fiat currency e t a t s t n e r r u c the advent of the fourth industrial revolution is rapidly altering the financial system and broader economy through the exponential acceleration of innovation r a fully digital system for storing and transferring identity attributes could be directly integrated into distributed financial infrastructure l e b a n e y t i l i b a p a c t i f e n e b e r u t u f s faster and accurate antimoney laundering aml and knowyourclient kyc processes seamless customer onboarding improved counterparty matching distributed fiat currencies issued by central banks could be employed within distributed financial infrastructure ensuring the availability of liquidity even in the event of systemic instability opportunities for integration may emerge between distributed financial infrastructure and a range of innovations such as artificial intelligence or the rapidly evolving internet of things settlement to liquid cashequivalent tokens issued by a central bank elimination of the need for an inefficient bridge between cash and new financial infrastructure the potential benefits of these integrations are highly uncertain world economic forum the most impactful dlt applications will require deep collaboration between incumbents innovators and regulators adding complexity and delaying implementation updating financial infrastructure through dlt will require significant time and investment three key observations must be taken into consideration for this implementation to be successful key observations and insights replacing existing financial infrastructure by dlt will require significant time and investment infrastructure replacement competing interests aligning key stakeholders for collective action will require difficult balancing of interests in the face of diverging interests and zerosum games implementing new financial infrastructure will require changes to existing regulations standards of practice and the creation of new legal and liability frameworks specifically the implementation of smart contracts will require additional stakeholder alignment and governance considerations legal regulatory and governance frameworks achieving all three key observations will delay largescale multiparty dlt implementations in highly regulated markets however if successful these could enable scalable infrastructure fabrics industrywide solutions and standardized processes world economic forum a b c new financial services infrastructure built on dlt will redraw processes and call into question orthodoxies that are foundational to todays business models assumptions that are central to todays financial business models will be impacted both intentionally and unintentionally by the shift to distributed financial infrastructure requiring incumbents to adjust their business practices in response currentstate assumptions transformative characteristics of distributed infrastructure implications for market participants within financial services information silos drive the need for detailed reconciliation activities lack of a single version of the truth and audit trails creates arbitrage concerns asymmetric information between market participants drives the proliferation of central authorities lack of transparency increases regulations on fis a immutability b transparency eliminates need for reconciliation provides historical single version of the truth eliminates imbalance of information among market participants increases cooperation between regulators and regulated entities lack of trust between counterparties creates the need for central authority oversight in contract execution c autonomy ensures agreements are executed to agreed upon business outcomes disintermediates supporting entities established to resolve disputes world economic forum a distributed ledger technology will question the need for individual books of record through immutable and distributed recordkeeping dlt provides transaction immutability which is a key requirement for eliminating the need for an enforcer of trust in the ecosystem tamperproof distributed data enables an environment in which trust is not an issue and allows counterparties to operate with a single version of the truth current state traditionally asset and transaction information was stored within physical books to independently reference previous actions internally and externally as technologies advanced physical books were translated into digital ledgers today every fi maintains its own digital book of record repository as a result central intermediaries proliferate in the industry providing unbiased reconciliation services to facilitate transactions between counterparties without requiring them to trust each other for transactions executed internal to the organization reconciliation is performed within lines of businesses dlt transformative potential at its core dlt is a growing repository of transactions organized in chronological blocks where the technology intrinsically makes changes to previous transactions functionally impossible dlt has been designed to replicate data among participating nodes in real time ensuring all parties operate off of a single version of the truth at all times financial services implications challenges information silos between market participants and eliminates the need for interfirm reconciliation disintermediates central intermediaries and reduces the fear of arbitrage within the ecosystem enables audit trails to be established for assets and transactions with a significant reduction in disputes world economic forum b distributed ledger technology will significantly increase transparency between market participants infrastructure must be capable of sharing information among all market participants dlt builds upon a single version of the truth to provide transparency for historical and realtime transactions current state the age and fragmentation of large parts of existing financial infrastructure have placed limits on the degree of transparency these systems are able to offer creating opportunities for information asymmetry as a result some actors within the ecosystem have gained competitive advantages through the imbalance of information while some entities profit from this state of information others experience suboptimal performance and spend excessive resources on risk hedging and liquidity guarantees dlt transformative potential the default setting of dlt is to provide full transparency into transactions dlt has the potential to transform existing notions of private records in which transaction details are only known to counterparties dlt can promote the creation of a public record of activity in the ecosystem to which all market participants have access in real time financial services implications challenges existing competitive advantage models that leverage information asymmetry reduces the role of supporting entities eg insurers that profit from opacity within the ecosystem promotes discourse in the ecosystem where transparency best serves market participants vs where opacity is needed eg secure personally identifiable information data world economic forum b distributed ledger technology will have implications for the cost of leverage by reducing information asymmetry between borrowers and lenders dlt enables improved visibility into the ways in which assets are being employed through the tokenization of assets and a public record of transactions current state in a wide variety of transactions types fis may loan or pledge assets to provide or receive access to credit however limited visibility exists into how many times an asset has been loaned or pledged this limited lineofsight into liens against an asset enables that asset to be used to secure multiple debts by the borrowers often in excess of nominal asset value this opacity causes lenders to rely upon reputational factors and assessments by supporting entities such as rating agencies dlt transformative potential dlt can tokenize individual assets eg property and bonds on a shared and trusted ledger to establish provenance dlt can provide visibility into assets and associated liabilities based on transactional history while increasing the efficiency of credit transactions financial services implications promotes visibility of assets and associated liensownerships to quantify risk and increase pricing accuracy reduces access to capital for borrowers by limiting the ability to use the same asset to secure leverage from multiple parties challenges the role of rating entities in quantifying risks world economic forum b distributed ledger technology will transform the relationship between regulators and regulated entities reducing frictions and improving outcomes transactional data must provide granularity and accuracy to regulators in order to monitor and comply with regulatory obligations dlt facilitates transparency between regulators and regulated entities through a shared repository with realtime access to data current state regulated entities and regulators are increasingly challenged to support information requirements to certify compliance while regulated entities are committed to enable transparency significant costs and risks are associated with current systems and business processes as complexity within the ecosystem and financial instruments increases the tradeoff between transparency and cost becomes a balancing act dlt transformative potential dlt can become a shared data repository between regulators and regulated entities breaking down organizational silos dlt has the potential to allow subsets of transactional data to be effortlessly shared with regulators in realtime dlt can facilitate regulatoryinclusive business models in which regulators utilize smart contracts to verify transactions deals in realtime financial services implications transforms compliance from posttransaction monitoring to ondemand and immediate monitoring improves capability of regulators to fulfil their mandate of ensuring the legality security and stability of financial markets improves efficiency for regulators to monitor trading venues such as overthecounter markets and dark pools reduces regulatory compliance costs significantly world economic forum c distributed ledger technology will reduce the need for intermediaries by providing autonomous execution capabilities financial agreements are enforced via a complex set of business rules and processes to ensure obligations are fulfilled by counterparties dlt provides the ability to autonomously execute these conditions in a shared and trusted environment current state all transactions involving at least two market participants are governed by agreements that highlight business outcomes based on obligations that must be met by each counterparty the responsibility for ensuring these agreements are enforcements dependent on legal and regulatory frameworks as a result the complexity of these agreements has given rise to intermediaries that mediate disputes between parties and resolve deviations within agreed upon outcomes dlt transformative potential dlt can codify financial agreements in a shared platform and guarantee execution based on mutually agreed conditions limiting unilateral counterparty actions dlt can eliminate the manual effort required to support the execution of financial agreements and can accelerate business outcomes financial services implications reduces counterparty risk due to the reduced need to trust counterparties willingness or ability to fulfil obligations disintermediates entities that currently mediate disputes and resolve business outcomes world economic forum additional research remains to assess distributed ledger technology feasibility quantify benefits and analyze implementation details past approaches

elsewhere throughout the use case deepdives a broad set of assumptions regarding dlt had to be developed world economic forum each use case deepdive maintained a consistent focus and set of assumptions our focus understanding the direct impacts that dlt can have at the businessprocess level on fis and other market participants analysing use cases that are broadly applicable in global financial markets occasionally utilizing us regulations as reference points identifying critical conditions for the successful implementation of dlt across the following four categories stakeholder alignment achievement of shared benefits technology implementation dependencies regulatory compliancerelated requirements governance administration and liability oversight our assumptions a note on security considerations we assume that enabling capabilities eg digital identity are available to be incorporated in conjunction with distributed ledger technology to meet each use cases goals securely and effectively we assume that distributed ledger solutions implemented in the near future will be scalable to meet volume requirements including in some cases billions of transactions we assume data sources that are accessible by distributed ledgers andor facilitate autonomy cannot be compromised we understand that benefits realized will be contingent on specific business models for each fi and jurisdictional uniqueness similar to any technological innovation dlt comes with a set of risks that must be considered ensuring that distributed ledgers are secure and safeguarded against errors is paramount to the longterm success of the technology and should not be treated the same as fundamentally questioning the strength of the protocol while smart contracts enable autonomous agreement execution between parties they rely on architects and security experts to build business rules that prevent malicious behaviour complete thorough endtoend testing and verify all code meticulous it controls must be in place to detect potential gaps in security across all the inputs components and outputs of dlt world economic forum through the deepdives a number of characteristics were discovered that should be utilized to identify other highpotential use cases in financial services through the examination of nine use cases a set of common characteristics were identified that appeared to be shared by high potential applications of dlt characteristics of highpotential use cases example shared repository a shared repository of information is used by multiple parties ledger that stores financial assets in which an owner and owned assets are tracked and shared with other internalexternal parties eg regulators and other geographical units multiple writers more than one entity generates transactions that require modifications to the shared repository minimal trust a level of mistrust exists between entities that generate transactions payments system collectively managed and maintained by a small group of banks but each bank has millions of end users transacting with their bank multiple parties within a trade finance arrangement eg importer exporter issuing bank receiving bank correspondent banks and customs that do not trust each other and therefore institute layers of verification and impose collateral requirements intermediaries one or multiple intermediary or a central gatekeeper is present to enforce trust removing andor reducing the importance of a central intermediary whose primary role is to provide trust to the posttrade ecosystem transaction dependencies interaction or dependency between transactions is created by different entities a situation in which alice needs to send funds to bob then bob needs to send funds to charlie bobs transaction is dependent on alices transaction and one cannot verify bobs transaction without checking alices first world economic forum section use case deepdive summaries world economic forum

beneficiary automated compliance the regulator will have ondemand access to the complete transaction history over the ledger world economic forum global payments critical conditions ensuring compliance via standard kyc processes binding legality of cryptographic hash to exchange value adopting standards and ensuring interoperability members of the ledger as well as regulators need to converge on common kyc processes to effectively identify stakeholders involved in the transaction and ensure a corresponding template data set is available on dlt regulators central banks and legal participants consensus on the choice of dlt platform across a significant number of fis will allow economies of scale and higher return on investment will need to collaborate from different countries to reach a valid legal framework for global payments why realtime and ondemand amlkyc compliance for global payments is enabled when banks and money transfer operators provide trusted and standard dataset on dlt why if the underlying solution is not legally accepted legacy solutions will have to be maintained in parallel limiting the forecasted benefits why different ledgers andor adoption cycles from key stakeholders would compromise benefits and lead to interoperability issues challenge the policies and processes of banks and money transfer operators to onboard customers sender beneficiary are diverse as are the regional regulatory requirements challenge given no legal precedent legal and technology subject matter experts from different countries will need to establish a globally accepted legal framework challenge the differing priorities levels of urgency and budgets of players will created obstacles to forming international agreements among participants world economic forum stakeholder alignment technology regulatory governance critical condition categories global payments additional considerations dlt enabled by global banks embedded solution cryptocurrency as the linking currency overview global correspondent banks can implement dlt to unlock benefits and increase efficiency in the value chain while also enabling next generation competitive services to local banks overview the adoption of dlt may be driven by key information technology providers as they integrate dlt into their core banking platforms they might play a key role on setting standards overview banks can leverage cryptocurrency on the dlt to facilitate global payments eliminating supporting settlement platforms and foreign currency buffers in nostro accounts impact nonmembers of the dlt platform would still be reliant on middlemen and their associated fees to offer global payments as a product impact banks and information technology providers will need to collaborate on a shared strategy to converge on mutual interest the use of dlt may be driven by the choice of ledger implemented by the information technology provider impact additional gains will be made on liquidity management and transaction settlement time the use of cryptocurrency will add to additional volatility and will demand additional hedging instruments banks would be required to hold cryptocurrency as assets on their books world economic forum global payments conclusion summary outlook realtime settlement enabling banks can fulfil and settle international money transfers in real time while increasing profitability via a reduction in liquidity and operations costs reduced fraud transparent and immutable data on dlt can reduce fraudulent transactions to a fraction of what they are today development of digital obligations smart contracts can be used to capture obligations among fis in order to ensure that appropriate funds are exchanged eliminating operational errors swift is implementing a global payments innovation initiative to facilitate global payments with transparent fees and sameday funds delivery but this initiative does not employ dlt currently the adoption of dlt for global payments by incumbent banks is limited although concrete initiatives are occurring in north america and europe across retail and wholesale banking opportunities exist for regulators to assess and promote the viability of prototypes and future implementations within current regulatory frameworks key takeaways unanswered questions challenge correspondent banks dlt has the potential to disrupt the role of dedicated banks that act as gateways to international fund transfers allow direct interaction between sender and beneficiary banks dlt can give direct access to most if not all relevant destinations for adopting banks and money transfer operators enable micropayments dlt can make lowvalue transactions more feasible to fis as cost structures are modified initiatives will retail and wholesale banking initiatives merge towards common dlt implementation despite competing interests volatility is there a role for cryptocurrencies as a bridge asset to facilitate fx swift what role will swift play in enabling dltbased global payments world economic forum section insurance pc claims processing world economic forum pc claims
