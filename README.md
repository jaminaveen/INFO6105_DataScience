# INFO 6105 : Data Science Engineering Methods and Tools <br>

<br>
In this repository, you can find my Data Science projects that we (Team of 4) have developed in one of my Master's courses. We have approached data science use-cases seeing it as an engineering problem which needs to be developed and maintained in production environments. We learnt data pipelining using Airflow and dockerized it, making our products easy to be maintained and scaled if needed. Built many supervised machine learning models from a company perspective where Data Science projects start from phase of Data collection and then Data cleaning, pre-processing, Exploratory Data Analysis, Modelling, and Model deployment stages of Data Science life-cycle unlike most of the academic projects which starts with clean data found online. The project covered these concepts:<br>

## Project 1 and 2: Fintech Hiring trends in the largest banks in the US (Team size: 4) <br>
Our goal in this case study is to conduct a study on the job openings in the top US Banks in the United States and analyze trends in the industry particularly in the area of Fintech<br><br>
## Project 3: Lending club Intrest Rate Prediction (Team size: 4) <br>
Our goal in this case study is to predict the Intrest rate using ML Models for Rick who is an investor and wants to invest in Lending Club with an intent to not take any risk <br>
## Project 4: Song mood classifier with Flask and Heroku (Team size: 4) <br>
Our goal in this project was to retrieve the top k list from the musixmatch web app aroud the world and use text classification ML models to present them with a happy/sad icon <br>
## Final Project : Graduate Admission Predictor for students and university (Team size: 4) <br>
Our goal in this project is to help students and university for graduate admission prediction.<br>
Stduents can use our application to get the prediction for there admission for Graduate studies in USA in Computer Science department.<br>
University can use out model to predict of the student profile submitted should be tagged as an accept or reject.
